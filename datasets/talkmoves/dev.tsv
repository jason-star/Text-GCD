Is it okay	0
I have broken my number line into two pieces	0
Mhmm	0
And then number two Id like you to graph the function	0
Which diagonal line	0
One final question	0
Awesome	0
This is where I need you all to truly truly pay attention	0
So this ones gonna be kind of the complete opposite	0
who do you want to play with	0
Why did it not show me	0

Exactly	0
So the seven you could have also taken it to the front	0
People there should be zero talking right now	0
Lance said that yesterday huh	0
You can see that we work with the same powered numbers	0
This is six comma six so the X coordinate six same as this point six	0
Yeah that s sort of what I heard David say same argument as  David ok	0
Good	0
So lets see if thats true	0
You have three more problems that you need to do	0
Charlie for 2A it says mixture B uses blank cups of water and blank teaspoons of drink mix	0
Talk to your partner and I want you to notice this you cannot find the exact range but you could find what the range might be by looking at your bars	0
I guess we can go on	0
Two thirds is smaller	0
Yeah	0
Come on go away	0
But for now you should basically do the exact same thing	0
Do you know	0
But I just want us to be like thinking about what it means if its a function or not	0
these tiny cans and then they  bigger cans	0
Am I right	0
Thats absolutely right	0
I know that you and Rachel are probably dealing with your sound	0
Two cubed plus two squared will be eight plus four	0
Aha	0
Then you have left over here sin2   1   cos2   which is true	0
Were going to put a couple points on here	0
Well kind of but I mean here	0
So here is an area model of this exact question this exact question	0
Missed an L	0
You need to make sure the very first thing you need to do is make sense of that problem	0
So the big thing were trying to work on right now is matching a realworld scenario with how to create an equation for that scenario	0
Hey Emerson	0
Friends you need to be at a zero	0
To make it into the little pieces	0
6 times 100 is easy	0
Im going to go back and use my same ratio table	0
Well we can count by threes to get to sixteen	0
Jack was another good coach because when I got it right he was very  and it felt really nice	0
One	0
Yes thank you	0
Okay	0
Then we will continue to the second point to these quadratic equations which we want to take a closer look at	0
And I just saw her walk in	0
Oh my gosh	0
is that our rectangles have to be the same size because I can say Okay I have this rectangle I got this rectangle and then I have this rectangle	0
So that means we are going to create Well there will be an original image that we will create but then we will have to	0
Eric turn your desk toward Blake you guys turn your desks Harmony and Alyssa Zach and Hunter Brogan and Lukeell Ella and Rylan Olivia and Luke	0
All right	0
Divide by four	0
Ok so	0
I think	0
Yep thats how it is	0
Thats interesting thats really interesting	0
We checked our denominator	0
She was like I dont understand this part	0
Edwin look at me you have a partner here	0
Okay	0
That tells me you knew that it wasn t a lucky guess that you knew it was okay that you actually did visibly do that	0
Dont hesitate to ask me too as Im walking around if your group has a question	0
Okay	0

28 x 23	0
Like I am	0
He wasnt a teeny tiny baby but he was young	0
Ill show you tomorrow the data that I get through this	0
If I subtract one yert I have to take away six people so I go from 120 to 114	0
Okay so t u is x squared	0
Sorry Drew	0
At the end of the day its going to be sad if you havent learned math than you know exactly where the iPad has been pointing the whole time	0
Well come back to this a little bit later	0
Nine times two for B minus one is 18 minus one which is 17	0
The first one says just so you know it says 33 so this is 33 of a block	0
Okay we come to D It is the conclusion	0
And you were going to determine the surface area of that	0
Number two I think is important and important to talk about make sure that you put in your best effort in class every day	0
Mmhmm	0
All right here was your homework from last night	0
Some of you said something about making it a formal decimal with the same number of spots	0
Label and units talk about this with your group too while youre highlighting	0
So x equals eight	0
I havent	0
I don t see ten steps	0
Thats why we have to have 135	0
Every time we land on a common multiple then well have the sound on the same beat	0
Right	0
You do this thing	0
That	0
Ah	0
How does that sound	0
Im trying to build a bigger model	0
Put that onto your notes	0
Look let me just run through that with you again	0
She wasnt finished	0
All right	0
All right	0
Youve already got it	0
Youre saying but you said it goes to eight	0
Uh jai mal a la	0
I saw some of you guys did like green orange purple	0
You sort of got at my question a  little bit but I am not quite sure	0
Thats why I had to help you out	0
Okay we are now going to go into our math lesson	0
Alright	0
Okay	0
in this instance Im joining	0
Thats what its about	0
All right lucky winning group today	0
Now they want to know about cups of whole flour	0
Brenda youre noddindyour head	0
I made a mistake	0
Okay up three sorry	0
Well if I know that fifty four times eight is four hundred and thirty two I know that fifty times fifty times fifty four times ten is five hundred and forty	0
It is and I dont understand	0
Six	0
Im telling you this because I know what this 100 means in here thats the distance	0
Thats why I need to see what they are so that I can solve them to make sure youre okay	0
That s an interesting question	0
Were doing this in your notebooks today in order for you to have plenty of room to create your ratio tables	0
Were going to start off nice and easy	0
the number of least to greatest that its like a smaller number than the other	0
Just a minute girls well just let the others have a think first	0
solve three and four	0
second version of	0
Now lets move this	0
Youll see it when were although were not going to worry about that stuff right now	0
doing pretty well	0
Were learning it conceptually	0
Tangents going to take a little bit of work you are going to have to do the copy dot flip thing	0
It might be 1 through 9 but it doesnt have to be	0
Right here	0
So we should do 81	0
I really like that answer	0
But then when I have 53 hundredths I have to go to five tenths	0
I dont mean this	0
I think were going to work on it tomorrow as well	0
Yeah	0
There are straight lines that do not have dots on them	0
Thats how I changed that into a division problem	0
The 3 becomes a 2	0
Im going to call you guys all Mr	0
Lets talk about Tuesday	0
225 meters	0
Thank you	0
Once we know we are going to multiply by five six goes in the ear	0
Lets finish these up	0
So first thing Id like you to do is circle this word similar right there at the top	0
So Im relying on one of you in that group to be the designated grapher for the group	0
Now you could think about if it makes sense to mark the length five five times	0
That is not good	0
Its just that  if you had it really big that is how much space you would think you could see	0
Hes saying	0
Im driving from Colorado	0
So in this equation you have to fill in P equals one	0
But thats what a protractor in general looks like	0
So if we think back to when we were doing KoolAid last week we can have equivalent recipes that it might not be the exact same	0
But the first one doesnt have any purples	0
Bring your dryerase board all over to the carpet	0
I did the easy part	0
You do not need to use a different strategy	0
Have you ever seen an elephant hiding in the tree	0
Give him a power clap	0
Me	0
10	0
So I want to know what are the factors of two	0
And dont do the additional exercises for tomorrow instead you just go as far as time allows you to	0
Lets keep going	0
Some people have been calling out	0
There we go thats 12	0
May I look at your answer real quick	0
I just drew five circles to represent my batch and I put the fraction 18	0
Not your partners height	0
I dont think its this one	0
I dont really know if his names Mr Khan	0
0 4 10 1040	0
You could put that in your desk for now and then you can work on it	0
Thats what you will be doing today	0
Now friends youre not going to say it wasnt because youre going to have to look at what originally made it difficult and how you had to solve it	0
Great job I owe you one as well	0
I can share with you guys sometime	0
Becca Im going to have you go first with I would like you to look at number one and tell me how you estimated that	0
On that I will fill out and sign what I can during class but my priority is going to be helping you guys with math and answering math questions for people who are like whats a rational function	0
Youre not following dBrucection	0
Good I wrote that down	0
So write your 15 over here	0
Im sorry Eli	0
I know what youre going to ask	0
Lets do it	0
All right	0
Two days	0
Youre only going up or down	0
How am I going to write this so that its a Donte I didnt ask you to draw anything	0
The distorted shapes got multiplied by different numbers	0
Oh well	0
Hi	0
We took one piece we turned it into two	0
So our picture needs to look kind of the same as that we need a top and a botCardo that are parallel so the two bases need to be parallel	0
You do this one for him	0
You can go ahead and just graph these points	0
right here	0
The first one is Abraham Lincoln	0
Mr G can I make a new account	0
Bye	0
Yeah but we didnt add four times 12 four times 10 and four times two then then add them all together	0
Good	0
So lets do the example number three as a first one	0
There you go	0
Mathematically we would actually say 25 hundredths	0
Well	0
So two	0
Yes it does from last year	0
You got to ask questions	0
And two of them have been eaten so that makes the fraction which is eaten 23	0
Once you have graphed them all connect the points in the order they are given to form a line graph	0
alright	0
Okay	0
It can be 2x25	0
All right	0
Oh	0
Have you decided that it was five and five cause you said that there was ten tiles in the paper bag and five and five equals ten and when we picked out more cause we   we didn t   we put them back them in you told them to pick out more	0
Okay so Im going to have you do halve the first number of the ordered pair double the second	0
Yes	0
That was  point N so write point N Now draw Now draw a line from N to S	0
I think theres only one piece left over	0
Im going to call this zero and  Im going to call this one	0
Its five sixteenths is the answer	0
Yes just for backup	0
So traveling from the 17 is Well get there	0
So I want you to notice the one that were doing right now	0
Make sure youre staying up to date on those homeworks and	0
We know one side and we know the angles	0
When she is five Damien is one	0
inaudible horizontal vertical	0
Going to where	0
And then leave the second one	0
Im going to say that you could find the original width and then double the original width	0
Okay	0
Because when I heard you talking you said Well how many times does six go into 100	0
All right	0
Yes	0
You hopefully see that you have a total of 60 squares there and you have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 15 of them are shaded in by both colors	0
graph these points see what you can do	0
How much money has she raised	0
All right	0
And the number in here is marked at the nearest thousand	0
Thanks	0
If you went to Target and you bought all of that not on clearance you wouldve had to pay 464	0
Oh	0
Okay	0
I need to see on your board what I see on his board	0
Youve only tried a pentagon	0
Why didnt it go to the next one	0
Okay so Id like you to write an x one y one the ones just mean that thats part of the first point	0
We got Precious	0
Okay	0
Wheres your journal	0
Uh that is number seven	0
Well now that um B is eliminated we can immediately find out A	0
Its like an exact number unless its in between 50 like the same number data	0
Yes	0
Youre good	0
Okay	0
And I want you to Before we do anything heres all I want you to do	0
You need them out right now	0
Okay	0
Yes Rogelio would be person A	0
There you go	0
So now looking at whats left over onethird and onesixth we can find which ones the biggest fraction	0
Ill give you one more minute	0
All right	0
Okay	0
Five and some number of 18ths	0
And then were going to subtract like you said	0
All right	0
Okay and then Im also going to label a couple points on here just for reference and then well go from there	0
Yes	0
Bobby says five and six	0
30 seconds	0
Thats number one	0
I love that I see so many hands	0
Sometimes it helps to look at a model thats a little different	0
This is three groups of four thats why we got 3x4	0
And so my hint for this one is you just set these equal to each other and then solve	0
If you want to write it out write positive B and negative B out	0
And thats the biggest value	0
Sometimes its tricky to get it exact on my SMART Board	0
Because  then I ll know how many ribbons you can make out of that  blue out of that blue ribbon	0
Show me in fractions though so write it as fractions just so we can see it	0
I see it	0
Maybe one that doesnt make me think so hard	0
Now Milin is  calling our attention to this first tower	0
The numerator was bigger than the other numerator so you would do just 41 and it was 3	0
Its freaky	0
if you dont know what it means dont worry about	0
Did you do it	0
So Id like you to draw a vertical line right here	0
All right sentence starters	0
Yes	0
Five Four Three two   one	0
Its 35 matching cards so 35 cards	0
Here is what I would like for you to do	0
Just going to have people come to me so get ready to stand up	0
4	0
Im a barbie girl	0
This triangle over here is yellow purple blue	0
Yes so split this into three parts as well	0
Then	0
We call this concave polygon	0
Okay	0
Were going to call this just for today this is Pirate Street	0
Stop	0
I can find areas by subdividing rectilinear figures	0
Oh youve got the labeling	0
And you guys I dont have you do the math Im not having you do the paradox on these	0
For those of you who dont know your 12s this might be a little more difficult	0
What about	0
Then youre going to solve your equation and youre going to get an answer	0
I am never going to change that habit	0
Okay	0
Charlotte pull your mask up please	0
Palo you need to take your Friday folder home it was never opened	0
So lets write out in geometry symbols what we can figure out about this problem	0
Do it quickly friend	0
Translation this is translation just like down here	0
And I need you to complete all of page 90	0
Those of you in Mathland finish up what youre doing	0
Yeah	0
Read them carefully because it could be another sentence to describe the same situation	0
So its just negative one half	0
I feel like we need to take a step back today do a little bit of review	0
No	0
Slide that first one over	0
We did not need to for this one	0
Were going to use them today to be able to model different relationships	0
All we have is this picture	0
Six and then 12	0
You are trying to convince somebody youre proving that your answer is correct	0
Divide it again	0
So so	0
Hey no	0
Okay you have these out and begin working again	0
This is what we just did with a little twist on it	0
I can get your attention up here really quick this will help make everything run a little bit more smoothly	0
I dont figure it out having to use a piece of paper with my little ones	0
So what I know is that 40 goes into 57 one time and then so if I say 57 That yellow is terrible hold on	0
Well all of you look at your work	0
Threesevenths threetenths and threeone hundredths	0
Okay	0
Thank you buddy	0
Oh rightyo good	0
You want to make three groups	0
Count your slices in dark blue	0
If I multiply this side by a it causes the As to cancel	0
12 x 12 is 144	0
Yeah theyre fun  and then you can color it at the end	0
Okay	0
Nope	0
Work on it	0
You could do this without pictures if you really think you need pictures to help you visualize this you can use pictures	0
This is where you put that pencil	0
So you werent supposed to try you were supposed to tell me you were supposed to describe what it would look like	0
All right	0
Then were going to do another domain and range example	0
Okay	0
We have one more sack	0
Okay	0
Thats the thing that we need to investigate	0
That looks like a right angle to me	0
Yeah because see four minus one is three and then that s how we got the three there	0
So the equivalent fraction rule like Alicia said tells us that we can take any fraction we want any fraction in the whole world and we can multiply the numerator and denominator by any number any number at all and we will get an equivalent fraction	0
Beep beep beep	0
And this would be five	0
Oh  I wish you would have written this down because I think you would have caught your mistake	0
One	0
Give other people a chance	0
So excellent job Gage	0
One whole plus 56	0
And lets talk about the same thing	0
So we need to find a number of plates and cups that meets her requirements	0
And not multiplying it by a whole because its not a whole number	0
Alberts Egg Emporium very official	0
Very good	0
If you like 5 x 6 do that	0
Hard to even laugh at a bad joke	0
There you go good job	0
This one you did something wrong	0
Itll just be recording what we do in class and it wont be a big deal just be what we normally working on	0
Is that all the same thing	0
So for todays lesson there you go Miss Overton	0
This is our old friend the grid	0
What I did was light greens were one half and the reds are one  third and the dark green was one whole	0
Yeah	0
Heres the bet Mr Adam	0
Thanks Mia	0
No this is just for me	0
You look at it like this	0
By the way part of math is explaining just to find your answer	0
Tom is five inches taller than Suzie	0
As long as I can see your work on  you may	0
So then the solution means that we just subtracted it	0
Because this side is equal to 50 which means the adjacent side is equal to 50	0
Well done	0
So it was zero comma something	0
We did	0
Do B C When you are done with B C I would like you to do math boxes five four and two	0
I think youre probably right	0
If we add up the numbers we have 7 plus 080 plus 001 is 781	0
And then this you have to add together	0
I dont know how I keep accidentally changing that	0
I got this	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
Were going to go through one together as a whole group before I let you do this on your own so that we can make sure that were all of the Jayline understanding	0
Well put a little bit of both in this one	0
So the reason why Im just gonna pick two points here	0
Okay	0
And youre going to hold it while you and your partner talk	0
Okay so weve got same side interior angles we found the value of the variable	0
Why do I keep doing that	0
Right	0
In your binders	0
So Dan take your calculator or over there on the table you can borrow one	0
We need to find this part of the base  to add up with the seven	0
Think about whats happening	0
Okay Jamie  and Michael said less	0
You have lots of time read the problem and then put it in your own words	0
So were gonna do a couple of review questions today to start off	0
62  821476	0
Yeah if you divide more six by two top and bottom by two you get two thirds	0
So now that we are a day away from it some of these cards were	0
Notice this is a model	0
So the task you need to produce a list of instructions so that anyone following them will construct exactly the same triangle	0
What I need from you right now	0
Okay	0
You can see	0
Tens ones tens ones	0
Yours is a little different	0
It doesnt even matter that thats a trillion or a trillion squared	0
So Same deal for this picture number two extend these lines	0
Yes	0
You guys we need to wrap it up	0
Think about what I said	0
Because a common denominator	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Are you ready	0
Theres going to be two doors on each side and then one door theres two doors	0
Im good now	0
I want you to check your writing down here in questions two and three	0
Here we go	0
Lets start with the first one	0
That would be way watereddown	0
Hifive thanks guys	0
This is what a couple of our strategies look like drawing pictures and repeated addition	0
Mhmm	0
Namely five   fewer	0
Do you want the fraction paper	0
Our answer was 11x28 and our estimate was 10x330 and 30 was close to 308	0
Weve been working on them so hard	0
Okay	0
Less than less than and greater than	0
for money if it goes over a hundred then its a dollar	0
Im not sure	0
Youre not going to want to draw a pizza with a thousand slices	0
Two 10	0
Alright everybody	0
Yes 22 because hes comparing it against Lauren	0
Oh yes	0
Hmm hmm	0
How about something that was certain for sure that was gonna happen	0
When I have you talk to a partner its purposeful so its not optional	0
Michelle	0
Oh wow	0
Ive got five	0
So Ill do the first part	0
Uhhuh	0
These little ones	0
All right	0
If we know that for every three times raised we raise 36 this is another 310	0
I kind of worked with a couple groups here	0
Like this you go over one up three over one up three over one up three	0
Because this is a subject in which you either perfectly understand what is going on you kind of know what you are supposed to do	0
Right	0
Yes	0
Okay Im adding	0
You know what your name is	0
Seventy six is it closer to seventy or eighty	0
Now she does	0
We want to get to one ounce	0
This is a Yaxis these are Y coordinates	0
Now we are going to deconstruct our prompt together so that you understand what the question is asking you	0
Youre turning around and having a for one conversation	0
I want you to draw me a model with your make me a model  with your Cuisenaire rods and to show me which is bigger  one half or one third	0
Well there	0
Sometimes the first five will be plus three and then the next one will be plus two and that messes it up	0
There we go	0
Excellent	0
Write an expression on your whiteboard or in your journal or	0
Think about that one for a minute	0
This place	0
Well	0
Thats sharp	0
Im not really up on Smarties	0
They increased	0
You guys seem like youre falling asleep	0
This will be the last time we give you a warning for a fire drill	0
When I found this problem I was trying it myself	0
This is going to be a little bothersome but well I want to know the present situation	0
Each person in your trio is going to have a piece of this rope	0
This is good	0
Very big	0
So just want you to see this	0
You can come up and work right here	0
Right now and first equation for the tumblers would be 8X3X22 because we have eight performers times three hours times 22 an hour youre multiplying all those together	0
You missed the entire lesson	0
You win	0
Lets see if lets see if two or six is going to work	0
Roberto is over here hes got this	0
Also the snakes are reptiles and the fish are not	0
Heres the question	0
One two three	0
Just actually take a look at your point and move it over three one two three move it down by five one two three four five	0
Okay	0
So the parentheses say you have to do whats inside here first	0
Twenty five percent	0
How about this one negative fourfifths minus negative onefifth	0
Yes	0
If I have if you got those all correct	0
Okay	0
Heres what you want to say	0
Im sorry	0
The Yvalue tells you up and down movement	0
And then tomorrow were going to take it even a step further	0
And I added We lastly think the X coordinate will be on 24 and our Y coordinate will be on 30	0
What I need is I need the getter from each table to come back here	0
And we know that its just four times the figure number	0
Your 79  23	0
Is that in EM4	0
Okay	0
Bless you	0
Theres two Forest	0
I know you had some math to revise	0
Which is what wrote	0
Here	0
What happens if it isnt exact	0
All right	0
Okay	0
Just like with those diagrams youre using over here you actually just calculate a surface area	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Do we do it on our head or on our paper	0
Bigger	0
Uh huh	0
Okay	0
No no no	0
You got it	0
Where can you easily determine the sides	0
I multiplied 45 by the same number in the numerator and in the denominator	0
Thats good enough	0
Make sure you are distancing yourself my friends so stand far enough away	0
And lets build our rectangle again	0
Yeah we need to turn it into an improper fraction	0
Theres no 7	0
Its when you shaded that you confused yourself	0
Okay	0
So can you write that out then we can keep talking about that	0
Okay and remember youre not going to get exactly the same question but youll get a similar one	0
Yeah	0
When you get this sheet of paper you will notice that there are dotted lines	0
Okay	0
Okay today we jumped around	0
But we love your singing	0
Okay	0
Youre going to come up with youre coming up listen  friends	0
Thinking about her estimate	0
No	0
I have a couple of different answers that I think would be pretty close	0
So if I have whats your I was gonna do 30 25 times	0
Yes	0
Because 5 x 6  30	0
And youre going to check with me so I can see what youve done	0
Complete problems one and two	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
It was the issue because he was having a hard time seeing where our place values were	0
Two people per team	0
were gonna write the equation in just a moment	0
Yeah	0
After well do minus something	0
I didnt go  equals 472	0
Lets see what other people think	0
Onefourth is  Or Im sorry	0
From what number to what number are there	0
Let me show you how we this on our whiteboards	0
Page 145	0
Why dont you do it on your your whiteboard	0
Right one diagonal away	0
Okay how about this	0
So think about being crafty	0
Okay	0
So it is sort of like that on the number line	0
So lets do that	0
Yes and why are we doing this	0
How much of each color paint is there	0
Im not adding those because	0
Were going to ask them questions and give them advice about what to do	0
Oh okay	0
Now you need to do coaching	0
I dont know what my base is but I know my height is five	0
Its like then it becomes 130 on this side	0
So and that was three times five and I know three times five equals 15	0
You can sit at some desks	0
Yes it is a positive 200	0
Im sure Andrew will lend you a few if you want to  complete your model	0
Okay	0
Its a little bit less than five	0
So lets simplify it like Emmie did before	0
We will continue this tomorrow	0
That angle plus the second one plus and so on	0
Is there someone you want to work with Salem	0
You couldve swapped	0
Thats why were going to come back together as a class	0
Okay well I ve got some of these that I made up that I am wondering if I can get any of them cause they re so hard that none of you can do them	0
Belfast is at F7 and Larney is at F7	0
I wanted you to talk through that strategy because I needed you to make it not make sense in your head	0
You can actually	0
So its just the sum of the angles really	0
I rounded five eights to a half	0
So X is 4 Y is 16	0
Friends here we are	0
Well I knew that seven times 20 would be 140 which is too big	0
So what were going to look at is how many times does twothirds go into one whole	0
Okay what about the	0
You know what	0
Were going to have time for one minute each	0
I see that Chloe has written the word formula on her board	0
I was about to say you could just do the line	0
He said I use the first one because the first one is the same but its a different number	0
So instead of simplifying it youre making it a bigger fraction so its just the opposite	0
Okay	0
And in case you didnt complete page 52 yet	0
It would be three eighteenths	0
Youre ready to share	0
She did not say that	0
Okay	0
One the one	0
Sure you could do it but	0
Answer to the first one is one half in case you have trouble understanding what Im asking you to do right now	0
For      one you add on one and it equals six so one plus six is seven	0
So remember private think time and then well pair	0
Dont mind me	0
And Im seeing a lot of people say this is not a function which is correct	0
Thats where you have to use it	0
So negative nine over six is negative three halfs or negative one and a half	0
We talk about multi and multi syllabic	0
Five	0
Yes	0
They will biomass leaves and waste poopy	0
Different form of thinking	0
So those are definitions for today	0
You should have a pen in your hands	0
Just let it there	0
This is where you can like start drawing pictures you can start playing around with the information that you have	0
Its not going to work	0
So now I have a question	0
Okay we have nothing highlighted there so there isnt anything new	0
Okay um last thing for today before I let you go is homework seven is on math Excel	0
Okay what if I only ate This is hard going back and forth	0
Thats not correct	0
This is 724 here	0
Evaluate the expression four H plus three	0
Row five I would like you to gather round Zachs desk	0
Here we go	0
no calculator	0
When I add I keep the same number over and over and over and over again	0
Oh	0
This says Use common denominators to find the quotient	0
Hands in your lap knees towards the board	0
Now I have one two	0
Yes I was just entertaining myself	0
Times five	0
Heres the five hold on dont put your pencils down yet	0
Great job	0
And then one half minus	0
One two three four five	0
It transformed with magic	0
Real world situations	0
At least try A B and C Okay	0
Okay the learning intention for today is I can use an area model to find fraction products	0
Were not going to yell at me	0
I know fractions like fraction circles	0
So for example for example a rectangle a rhombus and a square	0
Okay	0
Beep beep	0
So I think its a good opportunity to talk about this if your graph is a straight line	0
Stop	0
Ten X smaller than	0
Thats the length of the base	0
According to Estella one batch has three cups of pasta and six ounces of tuna	0
Awesome	0
Okay so I want you to look at that	0
Yes it does	0
So now You guys did one two	0
I need Five more pieces to get to a whole	0
Okay over here	0
Without talking	0
Thats all right	0
No I didnt	0
If were rounding to the nearest thousandths I want everyone to point to the number in the thousandths place	0
Maggie	0
I saw some really great conversations	0
Merrill Lillian	0
Okay	0
Is	0
So if I look at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 years	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
Im going to write that here	0
So I see a couple people wrote their equation	0
Now Im going to need you back in your seat in one minute	0
One times A is A	0
Sure	0
Excuse me friends	0
Our thousand two thousand four thousand six thousand	0
And how	0
Zero yeah thats right	0
Crosses at the middle and cross it 90 degrees	0
So everybody find the movie location and give me the coordinates and Ill count down before you give me the movie coordinates	0
So its understanding that if something is at 30 I know its going to be less than half percent	0
But how	0
If you want to eat it for a snack you know where to put it	0
Do you see how Im kind of struggling to draw pictures	0
But Tate I can read your equation and Phillipa I can read yours	0
Okay	0
Got it	0
And then well get into our lesson for today	0
So if youre using a particular rule of multiplying if  you can explain to me why that works were going to share  that tomorrow were coming back tomorrow and we can  start sharing so whatever you did to get your answers I  want you to write up a story to us to explain it to us	0
The Woot math polls	0
So 25 centimeters over 15 kilometers	0
Thank you	0
I have two people who are confident they have the correct answer	0
So do these represent these and why or why not	0
That works	0
Yes	0
That 80 is going to go in and this grade is going to get exed out from their gradebook and Im going to put an 80 in right there	0
So we agree that one half is equal to two fourths is equal to three sixths	0
Good	0
It doesnt matter just use that one	0
If you two have made a conjecture prediction about whats going to happen go ahead and plot fill in the coordinates doubling the first pairs and build a new sailboat numberwise	0
Okay	0
Lets see what happens here	0
Thats right	0
You got 110	0
Then we will get you yours very soon	0
Okay look at this	0
Eighty	0
So its really the y value is always one more than the x	0
Make sure they get put in the baggie so they dont get lost	0
Check your number one list	0
And I need to multiply one by three as well so that its an equivalent fraction	0
Youre taking a fraction of a fraction	0
No	0
Yes	0
Yes	0
The intersection	0
Or one minute	0
Bom bom	0
Why dont the three of you  come over here pull your chair over here Brian	0
Were going to do 10 x 30 10 x 4 7 x 30 and 7 x 4 and have a lot of adding	0
Some of you who math comes pretty easily its fun to do it the other way	0
Okay so you asked yourself a different question	0
So well go from there	0
Were going to take another three seconds	0
What are we	0
That could be another one	0
And then this slope of negative one half means every time x goes up by one y goes down by a half	0
A dead marker	0
Whose piece did	0
Then its over it	0
Okay	0
Go ahead and move on	0
You did it	0
Okay	0
Yes if I look over here I want you to just pay attention to this part right here	0
Yes	0
Two by two partner A I would like you to say what the mode is	0
Then its like I know Im trying to get to one so Im just going to find a common factor	0
Georgia okay she needs a partner	0
Ms Koski when we are going to practice Showdown and Pairs Compare with  then do the lesson and then we ll do Showdown and Pairs Compare with the math one of the pages	0
Grid paper	0
It is not very accurate thats correct	0
All right I have another one for you	0
And negative threehalves means you went down three and over two so theres your line right there	0
I just Then youre just going to stop and Im going to We should be ready to discuss	0
Its called Queen Arlenes dilemma and its taking that to a different level	0
Thats right	0
Okay	0
Being able to look at this and understand the wholes versus the tenths hundredths thousandths that Im breaking them into smaller pieces	0
Yeah	0
Thank you	0
Oh	0
Fix your answer if you need to	0
Right	0
Now Im going to tell you I feel like 141 its not a super friendly number	0
Here is what I want to see	0
Its a two step one	0
Nine	0
We have a recipe for one batch of cookies that calls for five cups of flour	0
See what you think and well do questions in just a moment	0
Thats the same thing	0
No I dont need you to read this I just need you to write it on the top of your first clean page	0
I am going to go to our math message	0
Okay	0
Dont forget to thank your new partner	0
The area model is representing the place value making you look at the numbers for the value that they are	0
Okay	0
Thank you	0
Fill in the blanks to make a two number sentence	0
Mmm hmm	0
So we could definitely use a model a number model to solve the problem	0
Minutes workedout	0
Oh we could be really fancy	0
Were going to do	0
So Im going to start with 141	0
693000	0
One I leave	0
So I cant imagine as an artist not being able to break apart fraction off part of your painting or however they might use it	0
So many people didnt even have the right number of bricks in their wall	0
So what you need to know about this today is simply this	0
No I mean like the one that weve been doing	0
Do we have homework tonight	0
Kaden	0
Okay	0
Unfortunately youre sitting in the front	0
Be ready to explain	0
Number two	0
And if you work with a partner I expect you to get your work done or thats not going to happen again	0
I liked sharing my thinking with my teammates  table	0
As a team find another one we could use	0
Im Im impressed that twenty of ten youre doing this arithmetic	0
All right my friends you are going to need to pull out your math journals	0
There it is	0
Okay	0
Give me 3	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Lilian turn around	0
45 degrees please	0
What about multiplication	0
Im going to go ahead and move on because Im going to push you to think a little bit more about the next one	0
Make sure I can see it	0
Huh	0
He tried to find a single calculation to find the length of the diagonal	0
No in the 10th place so the three goes here	0
Thats correct	0
Thank you you can put on the counter	0
Now I want you for what were moving onto today to actually make them equal piles	0
Imagine you owe someone 45 of 1 and then you make 1 15	0
Then we simplified it	0
Sorry	0
For this problem	0
Ooh but I need units	0
We took the square of this rightangled side	0
All right	0
Yes I think it is important to talk about it every two seconds three meters	0
Yes we are	0
Three	0
Shh	0
Its going to be a little faster because we dont actually have to write as much	0
Okay	0
Okay thats good	0
But were not though were keeping them the same	0
And it sounds like you felt reRamona comfortable doing that as 45 instead so lets multiply both of these by 10	0
Thats negative two	0
I just saw somebody who do this and wrote six in their ratio table absolutely thats totally what were trying to get to	0
Well have you play together this game	0
Yes erase your boards clean	0
LEES Sorry LESS Graham stay on topic	0
A lot of you did not draw a model	0
No	0
Show me how you did the next one	0
I will know I am successful when I can accurately solve problems one through five on page 209	0
All right	0
and silent	0
If theres two in the group youll be if theres three in the group youll be drawing the other two triangles	0
I go What is the reason	0
Add to the picture to make your own drawing to show how you found the amount of the whole casserole that group B took	0
20 over 15	0
Wait is this supposed to have the same response as	0
All right	0
Okay I have six 7 of 20 responses	0
A good question though	0
You also then have two rectangular ears and theres your robot	0
Cut it into two triangles so we got that the sum of interior angles is equal to the sum of the angles of two triangles	0
This is pretty easy to do	0
Yeah	0
No like this	0
Okay so this is a function	0
Okay	0
Meaning thirty	0
Thats her 12	0
Seth is the only one in the room	0
You are going to get this sheet of paper	0
Everybody should have written down the addition number sentence	0
Yes	0
Then for the sandwiches I did 3X18 because 5X6 is 30 and then times 18 because there was 18 packages	0
But that isnt the length of 15	0
A dang it now that you smack your forehead and get better at the future is sweet	0
Can you borrow one from somebody	0
I just heard it	0
Awesome	0
Here	0
Say this problem was on a test or something would both equations both work be the answer to the problem	0
Okay	0
Oh	0
Yeah I can hear you	0
Then would you pass it to the back	0
If needed draw a diagram	0
Youre right on	0
Okay	0
One	0
Yes	0
Factor everything cancel out any common factors in the numerators and denominators	0
You should have an answer for A an answer for B and an answer for C to come up with three answers	0
Go ahead	0
This 2 represents 2 more bags full of marbles so far	0
Okay so I see some people making some progress here	0
Ten	0
They all come out to this theorem where no matter what if you have that secant and the tangent	0
He ate half of them	0
I want you to try this	0
I was giving everyone else one	0
Hes putting another blue	0
I want both problems solved	0
Come on guys	0
Youre going to Denisas team Petra goes to her as well Bara quietly please	0
Okay	0
I said you must what	0
All right	0
We have 13 and sum number of 124s minus five and some number of 124s okay	0
I kind of agree and disagree because I agree with what Tom said dont you have to subtract the denominator but also 12 minus eight minus onethird it doesnt equal three	0
Ok thats interesting	0
I hear  some wonderful thinking here	0
Yeah	0
I know	0
Its not closest to two	0
Like I said youre going to have to watch carefully because its a little tricky	0
51 times three does not equal three and 14 times two does not equal 10	0
If you wanted to find that you now have	0
Okay	0
Okay so the entire base is 19	0
Were going to do it on Monday so dont worry	0
So Id like you to write times three on both sides	0
Im going to hang on to that for just a minute	0
I can see very well thank you	0
All right pretty happy with what Im seeing	0
Then we can think of this as two fourths	0
Take your ruler find one half at the very top of your paper put your pencil on it as straight as you can and look down at your twelfths	0
We cant multiply it	0
Then we have 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 2500	0
T	0
But in the beginning it seemed a bit weird but now I understand it	0
Fractions are parts of a whole	0
Even though you only need to do one of each if you want more practice these are great problems to get extra practice on	0
No thats not reasonable	0
Dont do them all at the same time	0
If you make this 99	0
Ill pick it up	0
Two and sixtyfive hundredths rounded to the nearest tenth	0
So Gerry has a  so what Gerry brings to the table is he really brings a good diagram which a lot of you  none of you guys had a diagram	0
I think I would like to put marks	0
Look at this little teeny tiny thing compared to my folder	0
13  13  13  That is a number sentence	0
two pieces of pie	0
Whod you see	0
Im going to trick you	0
Yes quickly	0
I dont have 500 marbles to separate out	0
Thats what were going to be doing all together in class and then youre gonna have a practice test	0
Uh huh	0
Well 140 yen	0
Good	0
Original pair	0
You cant turn three into four	0
I cant do it up here	0
It is a segment	0
I have a remainder of 2 and I got an answer of 32 and 25	0
So if you think about that pattern that kind of gives away the equation too	0
Id go from a hundred points Ive had my ride now its 94	0
Our whole of five divided into groups that are the size of threehalves	0
Yes	0
Its these points	0
When you have completed page 146 and 147 you are going to play the fraction of were not going to play decimal topic yet	0
All right	0
Well not really but if you really have to I suppose	0
14  14  12	0
Right	0
Nope	0
Okay so if youre doing rise over run for each week these first two would be negative five over one which is just negative five	0
Okay	0
What I explained yesterday on how you can write out those roots in different ways	0
Right	0
So thats one way you could approach this	0
All right	0
Flip to page 134 in your math journals	0
Okay stop	0
Mike says its half	0
So we can say 60 and 18	0
Ill put that in the chat before the end of class today	0
Lets see	0
So a function is a special type of relation or a relationship	0
So thats how you get the answer zero and five tenths	0
Thank you	0
Okay my four friends with their hands up in the air	0
Oh interesting	0
Page 15	0
Okay	0
She didnt have to did she	0
So crew I want to focus on these two ratio statements at the beginning	0
Okay	0
Im sorry I interrupted you	0
And from the blue	0
So we will be interpreting data looking at graphs and figuring out what those patterns mean	0
Im not sure I follow you yet	0
I have to put in Annabelle or it doesnt come up	0
I love that even more	0
David gave us both of these	0
We will not been going outside for recess at time we will try to double check before lunch in regards to see if the weather has improved	0
We cant change halves to thirds	0
Okay do you think I can make a problem that is so hard that even Ankur and Brian and Amy Lynn can t do it	0
Thank you very much	0
variable each	0
You check thats what Im doing yes to the nearest ones go ahead	0
Okay	0
There we go	0
Yeah	0
Nope it didnt	0
Lets give her a power clap for sharing	0
Okay Im going to put this here	0
For those of you who are listening I saw some eyes glazed over	0
We need to be respectful of that	0
Ok	0
Make sure you are writing your name	0
And actually I just changed my mind were going to do slide 6 together	0
Oh	0
Just do the numerator times the denominator	0
and it went like 00 something	0
Really if you have  with just a trapezoid and a rhombus	0
All right	0
Okay	0
I used remainders of problem two because there would be two boxes but I cant leave any out so I had to add one extra box for the remaining oranges	0
Now if it was marbles youre absolutely right	0
Okay theres a word for this in a second that were going to get to	0
You pick which ones you want to skip	0
Okay take a break	0
Mmhmm	0
Thats a 13	0
Everybody does these three	0
The base	0
SS right person three I want you to find 23	0
Okay	0
Great	0
And then the perimeter can be applied to the length of the circumference	0
I just thought of	0
Sarab why don t you come up here and do some drawing and Gazal why don t you come up and do some recording	0
The first thing I want to do	0
Not yet	0
Let me see your Chromebook real quick	0
Joey you need to get your your computer play hidden treasure	0
So I cut them all in fourths and then in half again	0
And so that means your slope is zero over six which is 0	0
Lets see Michael and Brian I know youre convinced I saw  you had that built	0
Draw an eightcentimeter line	0
Its what Im basing my data off of	0
Cool	0
I just said it	0
And getting that 3 to find the 9 in all	0
There we go okay	0
So Id have to think about this	0
You cant add until you get the same denominators	0
Would it be 15 divided by 23	0
But as long as one person smiles that that makes it worth it to me	0
Perfect	0
Mix the bags up like that	0
Now heres the misconception that a lot of kids make	0
Okay seeing a couple people in the chat saying 249 times four	0
You need to pay attention to this and not just write down the answers	0
We had four fifths we had seven eighths and three fifths	0
Now heres a cool little thing a cool little trick	0
Three and 12 divided by 58 yes this is in your note catcher but dont look yet	0
All right	0
Okay	0
No	0
Okay	0
Because  and then its kind of hard when youve got a remainder to subtract	0
Whoops	0
In your number model dont you just put a  and not the answer	0
Were going to go through our GEMS	0
What is mathematics	0
So Im going to show this one	0
I think weve given her that information	0
And were going to talk about that a lot today because its helpful to know what that means	0
All right	0
I lost my marker	0
I think if I put it right here okay	0
But the question is how do we do that	0
Okay	0
Go	0
We cant go down	0
Two common denominators for each of these fractions	0
So let me write actually the couple options	0
So I think itll be wider because	0
Here are methods like that	0
Go for it	0
Alright	0
She got a fifth from here	0
Show me how you can make a whole with just a trapezoid and a rhombus since were having to have both	0
Thats a good start	0
It is	0
The first six multiples of eight are eight 16 24 32 40 and 48	0
Then on Thursday we did 511 which is why were on 512 today	0
did we lose Evie	0
First of all you must figure out the estimate	0
And this is 50	0
There we go	0
Im looking for multiples that are the same	0
Right Loes	0
Okay	0
It sounds like you guys have been doing a lot of cooking that you definitely know how this works	0
Its already out	0
We dont want to say   wholes  or anything like that	0
Forty	0
You dont need your book right now either	0
All of you have one	0
I just said that	0
All right	0
We actually have one and seven sixths minus one and four sixths	0
How do you work out percentage	0
Someone bumped something	0
Three four five six	0
Some days Stanley this seems harder than it needs to be	0
Just click on the link	0
How am I gonna get A to the zero power as a solution	0
Just write as much as you can	0
The fourth grade chess team is planning a fundraiser	0
I dont know why this keeps popping up here	0
This is about tuition room and board at colleges and universities	0
Perfect	0
Okay	0
do you want me to switch to the other picture or this one	0
All right	0
Nice job	0
Lets see	0
So we are doing great	0
You said	0
You got this youve got this	0
Write it with red or some color	0
So the first thing I will do is I will rewrite this as 833 divided by divided by seven	0
10 divided by 12 then which has to be	0
Okay	0
Last Friday we started to discuss the power of a number	0
Probably	0
All right	0
540 Thank you	0
So your name down here would be okay I want you to do that	0
No seven going down	0
Look at it	0
Stella whos your partner	0
That way we can kind of keep track of the first word we get is the first number we get	0
You are a table group one and two please go pick your partner	0
Were still recording	0
When we do Pairs Compare youd like to stand up and go check with them to make sure you have the same answer	0
kind of use in our little properties for this one	0
At this point it is definitely time for science	0
163 plus 120 plus 101	0
I would like everyone to give Andrea and Adelle two snaps	0
We double the X and we double the Y	0
Its nine	0
What I think they did is maybe guess at the difficulty	0
Today I learned or today I practiced	0
Okay	0
No	0
Even on these ones that are pretty straight forward I want to see each one of your steps	0
Lines extend forever and ever line segments starting point stopping point ray starting point no ending point	0
Okay	0
But those people a lot of times they go to grocery stores they buy a big container of water a big pallet of water maybe 48 or 60 water bottles	0
Yes like behind a boat	0
Okay were going to take 20 minutes of class time	0
So you would just divide	0
Very very common for us to put a question like this on the summative test over this unit	0
Were going to make it equal	0
Way back here Dont judge me if I dont write the same number of zeros	0
I made it too difficult	0
There you go	0
And were going to go 345 were gonna go all the way up to x equals five and figure out what the pattern is here	0
So I know which question they answered I know what they got as their final answer because they wrote it in the answer block and I can see their work	0
Me I have that	0
One sixth plus one sixth plus one sixth plus one sixth equals four sixth	0
How do I make the like the screen like half screen	0
If I reread my answer now it says To solve this problem 47 divided by six I got seven remainder five therefore I know the farmer put five carrots on the partially filled tray	0
And I did it in US traditional multiplication	0
Only one person	0
No this data is only concerned with a certain period of time over this past year	0
Im returning my half and half	0
So you didnt get a chance to check thatyour answer should be 105	0
Yeah	0
Theres lots of options for C Theres at least four options that you can find	0
Your paper if youve got this remember I have my whole and Im going to split it into fourths	0
I need to move Cole down is what I need to do	0
Okay so page one page two page three	0
Then they have a guess what the surface area of the earth is squared miles	0
I did have a couple of groups who got this all on their own I think	0
Number 2 were going to talk about the homework	0
But theres one part you need to add and you need to add in this x after the one half or the 05	0
Okay	0
Lets say I went to Little Caesars and I bought a pizza	0
Then prepare just your notebooks	0
The new trapezoid is twice as wide as the original trapezoid	0
Okay whats nice and if you already have written down I want you to write one more thing down as Im talking	0
The rest of you kind of work together to make sure its accurate	0
Okay	0
Okay I want you to listen as theyre explaining this because youre going to explain to me the misconception at the end	0
Man this is just like my birthday	0
Addition	0
Okay	0
Im turning this over to you momentarily	0
If you log out that means this weekend or next week you can log back into this test at any time without having to ask me for permission to do that	0
Good	0
If I said this was my base  actually Ill do it the other way around	0
Well you see	0
Six plus 10	0
A partner A and partner B it must be someone youre sitting by	0
and Im going to get a really skinny U right there	0
So if you use a number line you would so on a number line you would have Im just gonna make this	0
Okay	0
Interestingly what the most interesting fact about meerkats is what they like to eat	0
In the like 9 times 16	0
Okay so I need to fix that	0
Please do this in your math journals not your student everyday math journal but your spiral	0
So the way to make this line parallel to this one this needs to be a vertical line as well	0
Okay and Raul I want to be able to see your work as well	0
Ladies	0
Were looking for which figure would have 72 squares in it	0
Here	0
R V U	0
Lets do a little bit of this	0
But if you can do that mentRamona totRamona do that	0
So Mallory make sure you look at the labels on the axes	0
And Mark has one  right after that so why dont you come up too Mark and you can  both ask together and help each other find them	0
And if you dont know the names of the dinosaurs thats totally fine	0
So whoever hasnt written it yet can add it	0
Youre confusing people	0
I just told you what it would be	0
Id like you to try that other model	0
So I want you to sketch a line that has a slope of zero and an undefined slope you can put it wherever youd like	0
Were going to do this one together today	0
Well yes	0
That make more sense	0
There are square well lets just say meters	0
All right	0
Yes Im ready	0
We always move horizontally and then we move vertically	0
Five and four	0
Okay students please stand up	0
Sorry friends I dont know why it does that	0
So I have a question to ask	0
Youre going to add those up	0
Here you have plus one and over here you have plus 200	0
Then you get a	0
Okay	0
Hold on	0
Okay	0
Thats wonderful	0
And then you finished the book	0
Okay	0
You can just tell me	0
Okay	0
Actually you can pass out one of these	0
Can we move one Pablo to Yarnells house	0
I also noticed in the answers the decimal point moved one to the right each time	0
Theyre the same	0
Its er erased	0
You know what we might	0
Then you calculate how many pennies is Mr Blacksmith going to get and if it comes out to more than one dollar tell us how much is it in dollars	0
Exactly	0
Weve seen that yesterday	0
What I would like for you to do is to take a minute I want you to look at that data and I would like for you to decide what you think the mode is	0
Yes	0
A lot of intro stuff for this section	0
Were going to be drawing kind of a lot of triangles today	0
Just show me you know it	0
Suppose that this is the triangle of which this side is 12	0
You can get your deck out	0
One of these locations not just a random coordinate but one of the things here	0
And then you just add the zero to your answer	0
So lets go on to	0
Use your fraction circle pieces to help you	0
One to four	0
Please stand	0
Because when youre doing the body and the arm if you just line up your problems correctly here you can add them that way	0
Remember we dont erase anything in math we just add to it so we can see how our thinking has changed	0
So these are the kind of problems were going to get when we compare fractions Were going to get fractions with the same denominator	0
So youre in Shawn make sure I could see your answers on every single one	0
23	0
Okay	0
Nine is bigger than eight	0
So now next question for you	0
Yours is going to be written in the boxes so its going to look like this one box one box box box box box	0
Those are going to be pretty darn small	0
Okay lets think about real life experience	0
All right	0
Brian is drawing models to show his reasoning	0
So	0
No	0
12 is open	0
Less than greater than and equal	0
So to me that means this side and this side are going to be parallel	0
Okay	0
Umm	0
So I have this pan of brownies here its 310 of the way full and Santiago P comes along and says well I would like 56 of that	0
Think about that	0
Okay	0
Lets do the next row	0
Im going to ask you to come and explain your thinking	0
Um	0
There should be five sevenths	0
Sylas says we have five tickets a day and we want to go to weeks	0
And when we simplify those theyre no longer equal	0
So then 3616 3617 3618 3619 which shows me its closer to that than it is	0
Everyone needs to show their work	0
Think about it	0
You have time	0
This is very good keep it up	0
Okay so I just want to make one point two points	0
No we	0
Theyre actually maybe more difficult equations	0
Do you want to say it to the camera or do you want to say it to everybody	0
Be quiet	0
That guy is going to be my biggest word in the word cloud today	0
What are a couple of things Thank you	0
In the white paper	0
So thats six	0
Can you wait	0
And you can if you guys got the answer	0
Getters come grab multiplication for those that need multiplication please	0
Yes	0
Okay come back to your shared screen	0
I thought  last semester too	0
Because to go from zero to five thats five minus zero which is five	0
I have two circles	0
I noticed that all the ages are four years apart and not five	0
All right	0
Why	0
All right five four	0
Solve both of those and then see what answer you get	0
Thats going to be your goal	0
Its understanding how to explain it and prove it	0
Okay	0
And thats going to be pretty much it for today	0
I see drawings	0
In your notebook put a star by a point or something you want to share and then we are going to do some explaining	0
Or lets look at this number line right here	0
Now lets figure out whats happening as we graph this slope on our current drawing	0
Yes youre right	0
But I just cant really find 2 and 6	0
Super scholar style in 321	0
But if you dont engage youre not going to understand the thinking	0
So your order is different	0
Theres enough to amuse oneself until 957	0
Okay if you wait until the next week and you if youre sorry if you wait until the last week of school and you say Mr G I really want to retake this quiz	0
I drew three circles to do for the vases	0
Look 70 x 30 and 70 x 8	0
Not the most important things for you to remember but if you do remember those words and you tell your parents tonight that you were doing interpolating and extrapolating in math today they are going to be so impressed	0
Yeah	0
Two cartons of orange juice shared by nine people and six apples shared by eight people	0
Okay	0
No	0
Thank you	0
All right	0
So heres my problem	0
parallelogram	0
Okay	0
Now the fact is to show there are methods like these um I think I would like some people	0
Theres 10 dots here	0
Ones flat	0
Okay	0
Our question is asking us when we look at it here how many times does one half fit into eight	0
Oh well yeah	0
Page fifty four I want you all toturn to page fifty four	0
To adjust for the movement right of that center you have to go XH2YK2R2	0
No drawing put your markers down	0
No	0
2 x 60 is 120	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
We cant solve this mathematical mystery without the clues	0
One and 536	0
Is there anybody here who has been to Costco recently	0
Take out the one five theres one	0
This last one Ezra wanted to try a new flavor combination for his lip balm	0
So thats your assignment	0
Draw your rectangle	0
Today is Tuesday	0
No half of X	0
Youre going to verify your answers with that partner then you and your partner are going to find a place to work in the room	0
If you are doing this correctly dont jump in and try and take the assessment because youll get ones on it	0
Because like at the end of  you get paid after	0
Well you could put the Audras fish and you could put  Danielles fish into Audras box because it s small and it  could fit in	0
Do it	0
Just use multiplication expand it one by one	0
Can you write them down more briefly	0
We could have started with 6 times 22 if we know that if we know that 6 times 22 is 132 we could have just done one step and were done	0
I want to draw a stick and youre going to tell me what your partner said	0
So people just werent using it that much	0
Calculations weve learned 10 things	0
I know	0
Lafayette Street	0
So I have 10 boxes of candy	0
She eats two thirds of the part of the veggie pizza she has	0
There you go	0
And if you go back to your seats in the middle of the room please	0
Im thinking of a number	0
So where were going with this the reason why I put these two points in here is because the rise goes from four to five	0
You can use any of your tools always to help you	0
Talk about your thinking	0
Okay	0
Area equals base times height or length times width	0
2800	0
Say that job that I have represented up here	0
Its a half	0
Okay but we should have the same answer	0
You could do 12 times 9 which would	0
It is a swimming pool problem	0
Its still accurate but it takes longer to graph youre going up by just a third every time	0
Three	0
like this	0
So I think it should be a fun lesson	0
Even if you are terrible at your multiplication facts which some of you still are you can do this	0
Okay	0
Ill draw in my slope triangle again as well	0
Cuz I think this was	0
So in some ways you know I want you to try and imagine moving from our rods to maybe a ruler and then moving from a ruler to what we call a number line	0
Last weeks lesson we learned a lot about parts of a whole and how important parts of a whole are	0
No Im not going to put that Zachet on	0
One or zero comma one	0
And I understand from several students that not all of the additional exercises have been done by everyone	0
Method of elimination	0
There we go	0
Sorry it must have been my mom or something	0
Do you want these or	0
The denominator	0
Okay	0
So I want you to write down 72	0
I want you to do the first one and make sure you make a list on the side	0
Yes because I almost dont see a difference here	0
So crew were going to do four divided by three which is not as tricky as it sounds	0
Decimal	0
Oh	0
Go	0
Of what is left	0
I dont want any reaction	0
Were finding another denominator thats going to match	0
How did we get everything else figured out	0
Get out your 14 and your 13	0
And then were gonna do two thirds	0
If we write out the slope formula for these points so T is negative three comma one	0
Were going to start off with a shape that you are all familiar with	0
So read the pages and do the questions	0
A common multiple actually	0
Once I thought that I was way better at it all man	0
Wow	0
So our numbers are and 46	0
Okay seveneighths minus fivesixths	0
So lets start off with one package	0
Lets go Mr Max keep going	0
No were not there yet	0
Supposed to look the same	0
Yes	0
You could also take away 1x if you want	0
Survey says those of you that have this on your desk congratulations you are incorrect	0
Can we ask Mrs Palmer if we could borrow her meter  sticks or no	0
I can represent problems on a coordinate grid by plotting points from one section and applying rules to ordered pairs	0
Everybody on this team has to wrestle everybody on this team	0
they dont uh theyre not as big as the blue	0
Oops I spelled maroon wrong	0
Okay rewrite those ordered pairs in the order in which they appear and then I want you to plot the points	0
I think that there are more questions that I can go through with you	0
Okay	0
sitting down and ready	0
Violet also deserves a golf clap	0
Lets go look at how we do it	0
So sometimes you have kind of like strange situations where it just works out y equals x thats this graph that just goes up by one every time from zero	0
Right	0
Be really careful because each one is based on the one before	0
My mom My grandma made that	0
Therefore when you get to a case like this	0
Can we use a number line too to find this out or do we have to	0
It says the following are populations from the 2010 census of five towns on Long Island New York	0
Could you show me proof	0
Look at number 14	0
No	0
So a line as you guys wanted to call it doesnt look like this	0
Oh its kind of like the	0
So when I made that mistake	0
One large container	0
All right	0
Easy	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
I see one person said positive three but it is negative three because its minus three in the equation	0
She wants the oldest daughter to get half of the land and her two younger daughters to get 13	0
Okay	0
Now you are going to get a piece of paper and were going to talk about it together before you start	0
Voices off in one	0
Ones	0
Okay so day one is gonna get one there one there and one there	0
Rename them as mixed numbers or improper fractions	0
Do you want to turn these off	0
Fractions	0
Two things	0
Okay	0
All right	0
Work	0
Okay so heres what Im going to do today Im going to be putting two AB groups together and so there will be four in most groups one group will have five okay and so here are the four I would like together at group one I would like Logan Giovanni Quinn and Julia can you guys get your papers	0
Three	0
Okay	0
Ha it looks like a hard one	0
Okay	0
Its a light chocolate frosting	0
Now what I need you to do is to come up with a specific way to subtract this	0
Draw folded lines and shape to show how you found 13 of 12 and 23 of 12 solving Evas pizza problem	0
Those I words I want you to use so that your answers are not confusing	0
She said three	0
Cuz a 095 is a hundred and 030 is in the tenths	0
Well talk about the backside tomorrow	0
All right	0
The product	0
Thats how I know how to do it	0
Thanks James let s give James a power clap one two three clap	0
Check Infinite Campus every day if you have any missings and Im looking at the gradebook right now and theres a couple people in here that have some missing assignments	0
Okay	0
First strategy similar to what we did before	0
Okay weve only got one more that involves you doing some work	0
Square roots	0
But what is it	0
Im chauffer advisor if you need help thats from three to 345 right after class today	0
He doubled	0
Well go one more time	0
You have a 10 but you have also 100 you have to change the 10 to be 100 it cant be in	0
No	0
Okay so we got that one	0
Heres the microphone	0
We talked about the first two problems which is why you cant see them but we do have problem number three	0
Good hands down	0
Anyway these are ideas for you to think about and argue about and wonder about and  thats what is fun about doing mathematics to be dealing with some of these really  interesting ideas and to be able to think about this idea about infinity and it is a very very  important idea to be able to think about in mathematics and we would not be out in space  if werent thinking about those problems	0
Concise means correct	0
Most of you got this one right	0
Marbles but okay	0
I can solve fraction problems with fractional answers	0
Do you want some coffee when I get back	0
So this reminds you of what	0
Thats my terrible five	0
I want you to triple the first number of the ordered pair and yeah triple the first number of the ordered pair and this one stays the same	0
Were only talking about water	0
Very very good	0
Your name is for that	0
Okay	0
I am missing what four people	0
Yes	0
Yeah after	0
All right	0
Quickly	0
Oh this is what we did yesterday	0
Actually even more as the denominator is one	0
Yeah	0
So 56 of 310	0
384 okay good	0
And we could add 12 to seven and get 19	0
It happened three times	0
So I cant say that this person understands	0
He has one	0
I need you to double check your answers and be ready to prove them	0
Lets talk about canceling things out at the top and the bottom	0
Dakota what is a treadmill	0
for the camera	0
I need to show minus 12 every week	0
15 minutes to work independently	0
Okay	0
If I ask you to do this I m not going to work out the entire math because I want you guys to have your own math time today	0
Okay	0
Angle two would be	0
Okay	0
Now this is something so simple but very important	0
Awesome	0
See if you come up with a rule on that one	0
Jake can make the picture larger by	0
Some people have made it a right angle but theyre still defining it	0
For those of you who are like Vijay and want to fight me about using your graph paper	0
These are called unit fractions	0
If I have you come up and teach one of these can you show the other way where you multiply your denominator because thats the better way to do it because youre always going to find your least common multiple that way	0
Okay	0
Youre going to have to figure out a way to put the 144 in the relation	0
And okay were going to do the next page together	0
My computer is freaking out	0
So the run between these points is two	0
If were going on a field trip I need to break you up in equal groups	0
Number three	0
Now lets just go over what we did yesterday	0
Okay you need to make a new list for this one this one and this	0
Really what I want you to do is get it down and understand the math	0
You construct a triangle on that page without showing the rest of your group and you write down the steps of how you did it	0
Were sort of you  know making up some hypothetical things and imagining some  things	0
And that will give you a graph as well	0
Why eightyfour	0
Close to a half	0
I am going to minimize this for a minute	0
OK	0
Okay	0
Three in the tenths place and a nine in the tens place	0
Thats a great way to approach this	0
I want you off by yourself somewhere in the room	0
So this first point is the y intercept and thats zero comma nine	0
Okay	0
but if you go  it would be	0
So if you didnt hear that Gabby just said that because whatever you do to the bottom to the top essentially	0
This is just really slow	0
56	0
Now what I would like you to do is I would like you to complete number 1 on that page which says Write the ages as ordered pairs then plot the points on the grid	0
Uh no	0
No	0
14	0
We did the first section the first paragraph under task to yourself right now please	0
Okay	0
No	0
Oh my goodness this isnt a trick question	0
This is a two	0
We have two so we put our two zeros in	0
Meredith  and David	0
14	0
A bigger angle could be a regular in this and that would be a little bit bigger angle	0
Every year its a nightmare to get these back in order	0
I didnt get this group over  here all together	0
There we go	0
Im looking at some estimates here	0
So this point right here is negative three comma two	0
I also pulled up some of the sentence starters that I want us to be using that we forget is this right here	0
No	0
You dont have to build new  ones	0
When you draw  Can everybody look at me and listen please for just a second	0
So we have 90 divided by 4 and 5 tenths	0
This one is B and is negative eight	0
Hey turn to your shoulder partner	0
Now Im going to ask people throughout the throughout these three examples to share some certain parts	0
Its a Jolly ranger	0
It totally sounded like you were humming	0
Okay	0
Thank you for trying	0
You just had it	0
Well make the best of it	0
Friends when I ask you to do something on your whiteboard its not optional	0
Kumar do you have your notes from last week	0
That too	0
Were talking like Apu from The Simpsons	0
Okay so multiples	0
Dont look at me	0
Okay and then be thinking why it is or is not a function	0
Level three five problems	0
Come on somebody be brave be bold	0
What was	0
Ok	0
Elsa you are thinking about doing unit pricing	0
So instead of dividing were going to multiply	0
He needs to put his glasses on	0
Ill know who me is	0
So Im going to give you guys just a little bit of time to do the first two slides	0
With this	0
Two	0
Okay	0
Thats how itll be the day after tomorrow	0
I don t know	0
So I want you to think about that for models	0
So lets see if it makes sense in this problem	0
So the problem that they give us is 284 two and 84 hundreds plus four and 35 hundreds	0
Okay	0
But Im just telling you how I got there	0
Im going to just write that at the top	0
I think that you had done them first	0
Total parts number of groups were going to break them into	0
If we take away five well get negative one	0
Quickly	0
So S should also record the ordered pair that describes the location of each place	0
Take off the decimal  in order to get 1472 cents	0
R plus three is R minus five over two	0
I want you to work specifically on my feedback and number five because remember number five says how was your prediction incorrect	0
Add up the Ys	0
Thank you for asking	0
in poor countries it can cause death	0
So I probably neShane reload in here	0
All of those are really great strategies	0
Yes like that	0
So I thought that was a good visual	0
Okay so Mr Julian has the right answer	0
And if all of these are together total of 112	0
What worked really well on first period that we did was this I gave everybody the page I just want you to try it out today	0
I want you to turn to your kneetoknee partner and your job is to help each other come up with a great image for each of these problems go	0
He went red blue red blue  red blue and so on	0
Could you do this at the board	0
Three times five is 15	0
Then Tuesday were jumping into now were at page 103 which is in the fourth investigation	0
You have two holes and four fifths	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
So like zero matches to one one matches to two	0
Twentyfour	0
Okay	0
And then weve got this other side labeled	0
Okay	0
A model for multiplication problems in which the length and width of a rectangle represents the factors and the area of a rectangle represents the product	0
This is telling me that you did something wrong here	0
Another way to do it is 12 minus eight	0
Lets just go ahead and get a piece of paper	0
You guys want to guess what time I was up until	0
She cuts each pita into fourths	0
10 and you make it nine eight seven six five four three come back youre going out there three two	0
Its on the  website	0
Theres just one little extra step	0
The first addend that is called an addend	0
I just want it quiet for myself	0
S Q U A is a square	0
So the surface areas of the triangles	0
Number sentences	0
Now I want you to look at yours and see where yours differs from Im not even going to say its right	0
John	0
I drew it up there for you	0
Okay	0
I am doing them with you	0
What time	0
I said twice to do it on the back  Keep going	0
Okay	0
three thirds three thirds three thirds	0
Oh youre out there	0
So factors up on the board it says you read about factors and list all the factors of 36	0
You too	0
thumbs up  switch	0
Oh how did you do that	0
Okay	0
In Math 3 youve got asked the question What is the horizontal asymptote	0
Suppose I had a train  now	0
Zero	0
How should you make an equation using all four fractions to show which ones bigger and Im going to start it off	0
You are going to We are not using partial sums	0
Were going to move on from here because we have a short math period today because so many of you are going to go sing	0
So 10X  11210 X  112	0
doesnt look right to me	0
Counting up subtraction	0
You had a way of thinking about them	0
I dont know	0
Yeah and theres a remainder	0
I did something similar	0
You guys stay with me	0
Thats what I wanted you to think about	0
Now do me a favor guys	0
60 times 40	0
Only minus	0
I m gonna erase this I think	0
Okay	0
I used 16	0
So all of these should be going up	0
And then  you changed your mind Jackie was there shaking her head	0
Theyre all on the line	0
All right	0
Yes well just copy the equation again	0
Were going to be starting to measure angles	0
I cant miraculously give away 600 marbles if my bucket only has 135 marbles	0
And you just drag it where you want the box	0
And so heres how you find your midpoint	0
Thats right	0
So lets talk about congruency statements	0
This ones 10 to the power of six	0
I dont understand it from here	0
Let me see where were at here	0
Kind of like do you agree	0
Right	0
Why do I keep saying Hudson	0
What kind of pie is it	0
Not difficult	0
All right	0
Theres two important things you need to know	0
Remember talk to members at your table	0
So Jirka Kral is going to take the next one	0
Um okay	0
All right	0
Okay	0
I need a thumbs up from somebody if you can see my screen	0
Asymptote	0
If I said youd double it youd be like sure	0
I want you to draw this fivesided polygon it is equiangular but it is not equilateral	0
Give your markers and your boards to your getter	0
Um and then well be here for a little while again	0
Okay	0
Notice that he explained that in two different ways my loves	0
Im sure five is probably more than you needed	0
Therefore I think this is better	0
Then if you add one of the eighths to a half it would be 58 because you have to make	0
You were born in the year 1980	0
For some of the parks the council gives the park designers constraints	0
So lets listen to Franc and his explanations	0
Yeah	0
It wont work	0
Oh my gosh well before serving thank you	0
Okay so hold them up so I can see your work	0
X equals negative one	0
Well take a quick break	0
Put your hand down	0
Look what I did	0
Right down the middle	0
So that tells me that if I have two yurts I have twice as many people so I can have 12 people	0
If somebody said Hey heres a class and here were their heights a box and whisker plot of their heights and heres another class and the box and whisker plot of their heights	0
I love them	0
There are maybe three of you	0
20 inches	0
Yeah we can find Z and Y	0
Lets look	0
Good	0
Let me see if its this one	0
Okay	0
And then I just pick the letters for the first one M and Q	0
Well keep moving these until we have that fair share so that here is our fair share right there	0
Okay	0
I see a lot of you following along and filling in your work	0
Okay so you thought it would be wider	0
Hit the switch at least in a second	0
Thank you	0
Okay you have three minutes that gives each person in the group time to speak so three minutes and go	0
Okay so but the answer is going to be no but lets continue working	0
Hes still not quite getting this part	0
I havent really known yet	0
Yes Ill give you a bigger one	0
Okay thats good	0
And I will ask you you are going to on the benchmark provide addition expressions and have students estimate the sum by naming the closest benchmark	0
Were going to pause this	0
I realized that a little  bit later	0
Okay	0
If youre taking one half of one sixth  youre saying you get one twelfth Youre saying that	0
Okay	0
Alright I have another	0
All right	0
Its easier to do that	0
Buy 10	0
MathLand Im going send you to your breakout room	0
Youre starting with your end number and then youre multiplying it by three and dividing by five on this one	0
Okay	0
Okay so you have the answer of three and one fifth	0
And so thats going to give us some hints about our slope	0
No	0
So what I do is I start writing 15 times six	0
Forty	0
Okay	0
And	0
So this you would say f of three f of three	0
Youll notice theres two examples example C and example D on here as well as this table at the bottom	0
I should hear someone say Oh I agree with you	0
Thank you gentlemen	0
Thats strategy one	0
One	0
Im going  to give everybody about another 20 seconds to finish up Cody Hugo Caspian you can try this one out that would be great	0
You need to make a ratio table just like this one but for third graders so thats their fundraising goal	0
Okay wait I wrote this wrong	0
Im so glad you asked	0
One more	0
And then you go ahead and subtract	0
six	0
Two thirds	0
Im going to go with Tim and then Violet	0
Dont give me crazy ones	0
All right	0
Roberto Im sorry you were out of the classroom	0
Not quite	0
Because the bigger the denominator the smaller the piece	0
Okay	0
Maybe because thats what I know right now	0
Yes	0
If you dont like the way youre seated you can change it some you know if you want to get into groups	0
Okay so just want to show you something in here and online as well	0
You might have to think a little harder about this one	0
And were going to kind of work through them slowly	0
okay then this one also has kind of an interesting interesting equation	0
Okay and then we drew a line through it it looks something like this	0
All right	0
Its like that yes	0
Hey	0
Just from having given 25 years worth of multiple choice tests and seeing all the SAT and the ACT sort of things I really think that the reason why this one gets missed so much is because of the amount of words that are on the page	0
There you go	0
The rest you finish by yourselves and the last example number six youll do too	0
Were on page 60 sixzero	0
All right so you re going to share until the timer goes off	0
So we have to have a data point that gives us the information we need	0
OK	0
Because thats a good place to start but guessing and checking is sometimes difficult	0
No	0
So you have a Oh actually got to label this as B	0
Dont get your DLI book out because were going to continue math after lunch	0
I havent taught fifthgrade math lesson in a while	0
Some of you whove got Number 1 write are done	0
Youre not done	0
Everyone please return once to your seats	0
Okay so you do it using if youd need to do equal groups	0
You want to buy cakes for each person	0
So slope is rise nine over run three	0
Can you bring your chair over please	0
Minus	0
Although they might bargain if it were at a vegetable or fish store	0
D equals D	0
Perfect	0
I draw it very short	0
I have a	0
Sorry say that again	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Nine problems that all use twofifths and threetenths	0
Okay	0
Your second question says during a holiday light to the store has three colors that flashed at different times	0
You can do this	0
Yes	0
And thank you so much for your hard work today	0
All right	0
That is a good question Quentin because as we do the next two itll be more reasonable what these walking rates actually mean	0
You can go on to the next one and Ill help you solve them	0
Right	0
As usual you can first ask questions yourself about the homework what didnt go well	0
Hold on please	0
Felix and Juliet you guys are on the right track	0
So in this particular example we have these two Write this all in your journal exactly the way Im writing it	0
I can solve twodigit by twodigit numbers	0
Gabbys work actually leads into a strategy were going to learn today	0
So lets say you find your slope but then you still want to write your equation	0
I cant use the same color of fraction pieces	0
So all we would do is rewrite our initial problem 112 plus onethird equals 512	0
That is what they do for a living	0
Then your negative two will become a positive two when you move it to that side	0
Yes	0
Yes do someone at your team	0
Exactly	0
I wish you guys could see Brennan because Brennan is teaching in the air on his screen right now	0
They are listening	0
No so	0
Okay	0
Sorry	0
Thank you Fatima for telling me	0
Guys I dont know why theyre talking while youre solving	0
Some people walk on them	0
One times three is three	0
Whatever your strategy is for figuring this out that works for me	0
Okay	0
We see that a lot	0
Yes	0
That didnt work	0
Um a line like this and a line like that	0
Okay wait a minute	0
Suppose I gave you a third of the big one	0
Same thing when we start to think about division today	0
You have to have ways in which theyre the same and ways in which theyre different	0
And this is your root	0
Okay no missing assignments	0
A A A times B B B	0
Oscar is in charge of oranges	0
In that case the X will not be cancelled	0
Okay that would be great if we took the time right now	0
Oh I see	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
We read it	0
I think that theyre multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the same number which is three	0
This is a building block of what were doing today	0
And Im going to draw this little arc in here because were talking about this angle in here	0
There are four purple dinosaurs for every two orange dinosaurs	0
And addition and subtraction are at the same level left to right	0
The biggest thing that we have to remember is to keep things proportional and Im going to show you what that means	0
All right	0
Okay and we are looking really good on this one	0
Look	0
Why	0
Uhoh	0
Thats sharp	0
Okay	0
I find that very hard to believe	0
At the big sale	0
If I were to throw up an elephant	0
Just keep your hands like that lets test  this	0
Where is your partner	0
So what you do is you list out the multiples of both of the denominators until you come up with the smallest one that they have in common	0
Lets get it done	0
Is   Suppose were the home team	0
I may have you do a few of them because therere two different types	0
Were going to use a diagram for this one	0
And if you need to let it load before you can see it thats fine	0
That is your exponent yes	0
So just be aware of that	0
Y equals one half X plus two	0
Thats super helpful for the math topics class	0
Be careful	0
Well if you put two whites against the red  rod and you put two whites up against the  red rod five times across it youd get the  same amount of whites as would reds so and  you got five reds before so you get five pairs  of whites	0
Now what youre going to do today is youre going to be writing in your journals	0
Excellent	0
Oh thats because I hit the freeze button	0
No worries	0
The other ones are all pretty short	0
Um now  he has a sort of complicated thing he s doing here but I m   wondering if there might not be something easier	0
Why is it not letting me present	0
Just like we talked about earlier how half of a dollar is 50 cents	0
5   50 which is 250	0
so if you need to go and read those you can but I want you to start activity seventeen point one	0
Solve these problems and show the step	0
Maybe shoot a drum roll before these	0
Okay have a seat	0
That one had an angle a line and a line as well	0
We could write new sheet for both	0
All right	0
Hudsona actually just drew a line on the x axis which is y equals zero	0
Ill tell you when you can in just a few minutes but try to do as much as you can without one right now	0
Okay	0
See if you have it even	0
Okay	0
Can you use pens	0
Teacher please listen to me	0
Okay	0
So we just came up with an equation	0
What was I don t know why my number 2 is wrong on the board	0
Im going to make a comparison of adults to students	0
Why is it not letting me print	0
Not working with me very well today	0
Okay	0
Follow along with me	0
We are going to begin a new chapter in mathematics today	0
So x A to R and P Okay so if you said angle x for this one	0
This is the ones column	0
So your slope is rise which is your y values	0
I see some different areas	0
That is such a creative way to solve this	0
Eleven	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Same place	0
Or you could do like three times two times three times three to kind of get that	0
Meters	0
This is six	0
Yeah	0
Thats why I didnt think you wanted	0
Okay thats why we keep finding them	0
Look up here real quick	0
So please complete the division problem	0
Well youre not going to know if you dont even try	0
Yeah the last one was a line segment	0
And remember that is nothing anyone needs to worry about in the back of the room	0
Lets do a couple more here	0
Okay	0
Im trying to help you Truman	0
Okay	0
And the constant which we found as letter K in the circumference is marked as letter Pi	0
Love it	0
Okay everyone in the room has theirs or is very close	0
Thats my pencil	0
So you have to test both of them	0
Yeah  so if I have two pieces of pita bread and it might be something like this	0
ones 10s hundreds	0
TssTss	0
Yes	0
Who else had a mic too	0
All right	0
Yeah we are at there	0
It is important	0
Now I want to show you something before you start working	0
That was your example	0
Well yes but that is as different as day and night	0
It sounds to me like you are a Shark Tank super fan	0
That was a lot of stuff today especially after I felt like we had some short lessons last week	0
Im going to start today with a family	0
Your old friend	0
Shut up and listen to his explanation	0
Go out to buy snacks	0
Okay so find a common denominator	0
You can see that theres two numbers that are the same one and two and the bottom ones one and two	0
When I started doing this it was before me went over that because no because the day you gave this to us I flipped out and thought it was all due the next day I was texting Nicki at ten oclock at night because I was already helping you and I was Nicki I dont know what to do this is due tomorrow	0
Thats what you have to look up within your answer	0
Okay between six and seven	0
Were going to start with the list over there	0
And maybe one more	0
Im going to Im going to ask a lot of questions and hopefully people will be able to answer today	0
Excellent job my friends	0
Actually can I have you move up to the first table	0
It will say 412 at the top	0
For number one two wherever youre supposed to be explaining your thinking you need to explain your thinking	0
You take that code you put it into Google classroom	0
So its like multiplying one number by a different number	0
Meters squared	0
What were going to do is Im going to give you a packet	0
We think that the red kangaroo is shorter and then the chimpanzees taller	0
Ok so you did ten you called it ten and twenty because of the little  white ones	0
This is the same as this	0
So we need to have a fraction	0
Yeah you need to go label it all the way to two	0
So let me show you	0
Yes we did it in class	0
Read and understand the word problem	0
All right	0
Cause thats the  the probability of this happening	0
Look at that	0
All right nice job	0
You guys go go go	0
Now if its helpful to you Actually no matter what I want you to add this in	0
Okay	0
Sofia do 118	0
Well  wrong calculations  five step  Its in your notes  where we have to find the mean we have to subtract each of the  square each of those subtractions  to find the average of those  You can totally do it	0
To find the small number you subtract the difference from the sum and divide it by two	0
Yes	0
So the y intercept is zero and then it goes up by four every time	0
These rules I think its most helpful to think of the negatives as opposite	0
We are going to investigate equivalent ratios some more today	0
Youre just contrary	0
Okay who s	0
Theres the midpoint formula	0
I see four different models I  see five different models	0
We got nine and 37	0
You need a bigger calculator	0
So you were right	0
Hands back down	0
Yay	0
Oh I know where I put them	0
See if you can solve this one for F Two f plus Y equals k This is your last practice problem before we do some release	0
OK	0
She developed a rule to help her fix the drawing double the first coordinate of all the points	0
Right	0
And Eric has seven eighths of a pizza	0
I I still want to see you build 3 up and then see if theres  any	0
I have kind of talked about this during factors and multiples though	0
Shes got six and 715 so help her	0
Parenthesis 30 minus the square root of 25 is five so 30 minus five is 25 times four equals 100	0
Yes thats coming off	0
And think about explaining how do you know	0
Okay ladies and gentlemen	0
But the value is approximate	0
Decimal alignment	0
And then just a reminder as well	0
Robert can you peek in on Jonathan s book or open up your own please	0
You have to divide them into fourths	0
One of them is correct and one of them has made a very common mistake	0
So you have Y and you have X	0
Yes sir	0
Thats one way we can get to the number that youre going for but thats not really part of this question	0
All right	0
Yes	0
So domain is all the x values ranges all the y values	0
Lets give Louie a roller coaster	0
Look we have a different model over here even	0
We know that Adrian was designing a picture for the cover of his reading folder	0
Why	0
Okay	0
Lets look at problems three and four	0
I really think you guys get this	0
See you have to remember to change that	0
Okay so Maddy if I divide three divided by six its not going to come out to two	0
So you want to add 100 plus 10 plus nine	0
Im done talking	0
Thats a little like youre taking youre doing it but youre taking an extra step	0
My math is immaculate right there	0
Sorry	0
The whole thing is one but the shaded area only goes here	0
Because if its an odd number of numbers it should go  boom boom boom and then your fingers should end up on one number	0
I am finding hard to follow	0
Were just getting ahead one two three four five six seven	0
One two three on your boards	0
Okay	0
Rays helps when youre doing multiple	0
Really dove into a lot of it	0
Okay those are the tick marks	0
Come on pull it out your paper and look	0
Cool	0
Oh	0
This one	0
Yes	0
We are estimating the solution	0
That one	0
But were really talking about multiples of seven	0
Kurt come here	0
Okay	0
Because were taking a fraction of it like Hunter said were only taking half of it	0
Boys and girls we are matching up number sentences with representations and then on page 186 you are writing a number story	0
Okay	0
Yes sir	0
Alyssa thank you for letting me use that	0
And so if we look here each one of these xs is fine I know what happens to each one of them its totally okay that putting a one in gives me a four and putting a three and gives me a four thats legal	0
Maddy will let you write your name	0
Thats what I did and it	0
First do times one half times 10 equals five	0
If you dont you could talk about their ratio as well	0
And we got rid of Ts because shes too tall with her shoes on	0
So you can see rise and run	0
I think we should all of them together and what they want for the answer is what that will equal	0
Multiply straight across say 364 which is equal to 9	0
We changed our denominator	0
Oh that was tough huh	0
Lets go	0
Okay	0
And then plot the points from the table	0
Put your hands like this if you disagree or you did something differently	0
Oh	0
Zero	0
Right	0
So I think theyre going to have us try one more	0
So one more time the person whose name comes first alphabetically is going to present their screen with this document so I can Amalias on it	0
Amy how are you to do with your basketball game	0
Yes you may	0
So the slope is negative two thirds	0
And then you can start thinking about Okay well Ive got two parallel lines	0
Yes so its a grid full of rows and columns or horizontal and vertical lines	0
Color in what Ive asked you to color in	0
Now I could put plus three and minus one here but I could also put minus one here	0
Okay now you can t talk	0
Because my brother eats more than me now and my parents so I agree	0
Okay Im gonna copy the link and I am going to put it in The chat	0
Then keep going with it	0
All right	0
But the book utilizes it too	0
You are right	0
Okay	0
If X is three Y is three	0
This number should always be in the triangle at the end	0
And at B youd make an angle 37 degrees	0
I love the people that are writing this down its a good model for them	0
Were practicing finding a common denominator	0
We have a total of 24 people	0
No we are going zero to by the way we have to thank Mrs Deming for making  us this number line	0
Were we supposed to meet all the graphs is the same	0
Youre trying to get it away from 100	0
Yes	0
So I have to now align my answer down here	0
Do we do both of these	0
But make sure you forgot one letter in your equation	0
Okay	0
This is what we learned yesterday	0
So thats how you get there	0
You want it off over there	0
I remind you its better as a fraction because if by any chance it wasnt a fraction which gives a rational number which finishes itself its not interesting	0
Yes	0
Friends I need to make sure you understand this	0
What youve got to do can I just use this cancel that	0
So its really just the range is just like these values right here	0
Five	0
Six by six	0
Give me a way	0
Okay	0
I now know information about table one	0
1  or  y  or  1	0
Ok let s write this down	0
Be specific	0
Lets take a look at her pattern lets see if it matches my pattern	0
Okay	0
I have 60	0
Now let go	0
If the red one	0
So she said So I accounted for 12 of these	0
This is how were getting our ratio of one box for eight Granola Bars	0
And then no standard form first then standard notation	0
Thats why ratio table here is so helpful you kind of do what you need	0
By five	0
Everybody figure that out on your own	0
Splitting numbers into either or turning numbers into either improper fractions or mixed numbers	0
Yes but that depends on how you look at length and width	0
Ms Koskis in charge of checking your work and	0
And that would work because thats six twelfths plus four twelfths equals 10 twelfths	0
Hold on a second people	0
Ive got to have cameras on	0
I am sure	0
All right so the second part of your job was to rephrase this to fix this	0
Erase your boards clean	0
We want to know how many times 14 is going to fit in so thats our first step to find a common denominator	0
Im going to record my 15 12	0
Three	0
So you want us to look at like the actual data	0
You just made it go smaller	0
Let me just do that	0
You dont divide to go up	0
Ah okay	0
a square without 90 degree angles	0
When you use your area model youre accurate with your work thats my suggestion	0
Yes thanks for telling me that theyre not	0
Two minus negative two subtracting a negative	0
Lets start with the denominator	0
Knowing that only the square numbers will be open	0
I know its tough to see with the yellow	0
Okay	0
So thats going to be BID and then this one over here is going to be the same	0
Theres multiple ways to think about this	0
But when you solve it you need to share your thinking with the class	0
All right	0
Okay	0
So thats our first paper	0
Why is Abraham Lincoln on the penny	0
Youre right	0
That gentleman will be taping a complete lesson on video as part of an international study	0
Can we still keep our boards	0
Yeah like Brian did	0
Im sorry	0
If she bought 30 cases thats 120 bottles	0
Its okay	0
Show me how to split the whole piece of paper into fourths	0
Find me a rod that s half as long as the blue rod	0
Are you starting right now	0
You my friend are not	0
Go	0
Okay well then Im just gonna keep adding zeros I like zeros	0
Thats better	0
We can think of this like a ratio table and I want to get eight to 24 because thats a common multiple between eight and 12	0
Were going to keep working on mean	0
Well you cant really measure that exactly	0
There is this triangle here and theres this triangle here	0
Oh my gosh I love all these volunteers that I see already	0
I would agree	0
So were gonna get four equals four for the slope	0
This is kind of a cool piece because were going to do this today for math	0
Were going to go over this anyway	0
Two	0
Im going to put three fourths times two thirds is my number model that Im showing with the area model	0
I would like to have someone do the letter A	0
That wont work	0
Get in the practice of showing your work	0
Can I use	0
When you get a function that looks like this you get a quadratic on the top and you get a cubic on the bottom or anything like that in which we say in nonmath words the bottom wins	0
I m talking about this one	0
So please do so	0
Not as much	0
Wow	0
Well they dont have it somehow on here	0
All right so drag the red quadrangle to what you think it will look like then press the next button	0
I dont get how you got the nine over 24 and the 10 over 24	0
We have 12 months in a year	0
Everything but a pencil please	0
I love math	0
But on the other hand	0
Use the information in the chart below to help them plan their trips	0
Okay	0
Those of you who are at home you are at a bit of an advantage	0
I think itll go to 10 wouldnt it	0
You changed my color	0
I had only one incorrect problem	0
Yes	0
We start with the 10 plus three which is 13	0
Okay	0
Were looking at page 86 and then youre going to do math boxes on page 88	0
All right	0
You do 4x10 and 4x9	0
And the way we label it is x one y one and the ones just mean that its the first point	0
From my first day	0
Good	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
No I wasnt	0
inauidble	0
I think I know	0
Decimal point	0
Then  The problem is is the images never show up here	0
Yes	0
Yeah thats what Im	0
Here are your eagle box and you understood that	0
Nice job	0
I know but if I have a whole its bigger than that	0
Wait so the narrow diameter	0
So this would be 10one 10seven twotwo 10one	0
All right	0
Plus thats just the rule	0
Surface area	0
One	0
Okay class quiet please	0
Okay and this one has a lot of things about the diagonals	0
You didnt do it that way	0
This is 3 so then that will be 20 this would be equals to a 10	0
That was fine	0
First thing is it is very important that you fill out these formulas	0
Thank you Lisa	0
Lets see if it follows me	0
There you go	0
You tried that one it didn t work	0
Gary ran one and two thirds miles	0
And I want you to think about how would you start to solve this problem	0
These are skills that we have learned about adding and subtracting fractions	0
Red onions mmhmm	0
Solve the numbers story explain your strategy to a partner	0
I want you to give a power clap to Jake and Mia	0
Sure	0
I love	0
Youre 100 correct	0
Oh youre adding okay	0
So lets see what that rule is without having to look at that table	0
I think we got everybody on the same page seven three nine five eleven seven and twelve eight	0
You should write that down	0
Length times 4 plus 2	0
Because heres where it gets slightly tricky	0
It doesnt not work	0
You are going to match each number sentence card with the representation card youre going to pick one pair and think of a number story that could be modeled by the number sentence and representation	0
Then please come take one	0
I think about it like a detective	0
Oh OK then five from seven	0
Thats a great explanation	0
No its not Or Else	0
But we dont want 20 to come out of the mouth	0
Lance I think you have a couple of extra dots in there there should be five dots on each side including the corners	0
Negative six	0
That would be four like four blue three blue two blue one blue no blue Or	0
How you draw the auxiliary lines makes the difference	0
And then number two you already have diagrams	0
All right	0
Two hours this week	0
Touched six times but it is ending closed	0
One	0
Okay	0
You cant	0
Multiples were going to talk about multiples now	0
Oh	0
Not funny	0
Otherwise I will get in an argument with class two B because they all want to reserve as well	0
Okay	0
Which one do we get out	0
Is this yours now	0
Ok	0
All right number three	0
All right weve got one more to go today	0
So just a little reminder about those	0
I did insert image from computer to upload	0
Yes	0
Hey listen up real quick	0
8 goes into 21 two times	0
If I have decimals here And I have three numbers here	0
One two three four five okay	0
Problem 23 a graph has been drawn there Brian and shown is a well you have to make an equation with it	0
Four is the price for eight avocados	0
Well if we subtract the information from column one and we only have 170 students and 34 adults that means that two kids do not get to go on the trip	0
Oh Im going to wait for you to be done	0
So this is the positive square root of nine	0
I have some more complicated ones we can do that have four challenges	0
You can cut them both into thirds	0
Listen when it is number one s turn theyre the only person speaking	0
Thats what matters	0
Right	0
Okay Ledger was right there are 365 days in a year	0
He invented the phone	0
Um its basically like the first problem he thought it was 9 cups of each so then it said 2 cups of chocolate so basically he multiplied 1 cup and then he uses 9 cups for cream and then 2 cups of the 9 cups of chocolate	0
Well yeah but	0
Okay	0
I can discuss and apply strategies for multiplying fractions by whole numbers	0
Theres one and a half	0
Show me what you have	0
Do as I asked look at those two numbers up there write them in standard form or standard notation	0
Were going to look at our objective more closely in just a little bit but right now I have something kind of fun for you guys so put your pencils in ready position because you do not need them for a little while and were going to do something called subitizing	0
Okay	0
See what happens when you put four in the box	0
If you have questions I will be checking in with some people about different assignments and things like that	0
This table is not having very riveting conversation	0
Ill send you a link tomorrow morning	0
Do Monkeys Smell Bad	0
What is that thing down there	0
Okay	0
Go	0
Wait a minute	0
X is one two and a half diagonals away	0
All right we are at 229	0
Youre going to take a picture of your homework and then put this so like an assignment and then Ill show you how to upload it	0
Explain how you know you need to prove it	0
All right	0
Read part A and figure out what answer youre going to be looking for	0
Hold on	0
So theres one two three	0
Youre sharp	0
Unless youre in a car	0
Better still take 12 each and hand the rest back over to these girls	0
Now you need to pinpoint it like this	0
You are absolutely ready	0
The one thing that I do not	0
I will briefly repeat it once more	0
So we have fivetenths fiveone hundredths twotenths and twoone hundredths	0
One different than the one you ve written that someone else has proposed	0
So X10  40100	0
The first thing I need from you all Can I get two Ms Levysintraining to pass these papers out for me	0
But Kyra Cody Leanna and Molly want to see your work	0
She is like cutting the number line	0
three	0
Okay now all your hands go up	0
Thats already there yes	0
Can I what	0
Okay	0
Shes going to just be outside	0
Julia where are you	0
You should be looking at this and saying to yourself yep gosh I hope theres a full bunch of those in the final because I totally know how to do it	0
You could use a calculator	0
Lets examine what points on the coordinate plane can tell us	0
They gave you a very simple problem	0
But instead I give them two glasses of water	0
When were done is it supposed to be	0
All right	0
Heres some words that you can use to multiply the fractions blank and blank	0
So its this one	0
Okay friends if you have a mic at your desk please bring it to	0
Hold on	0
Weve practiced counting by threes	0
Alright well what happened was I was playing the game with my dad	0
You are	0
But you need to put the tick marks in	0
The total height of the shape so think about a part	0
If I put 12 in the ear and I divide by four	0
Yeah	0
Im going to grab my sticks again	0
Okay so Im about to go to the grocery store and I hear from everybody and theyre like Oh T we have a science test tomorrow that we have to study for	0
Guys don t forget we re subtracting not adding	0
Could you say that	0
Thank you	0
I dont know how I got the eraser on but I will fix it	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Thank you for letting me know	0
Yeah	0
I have four leftover for me	0
The three by three array	0
Yes	0
312	0
Plugging in my iPad	0
Okay lets move on to angles	0
Here are some tips for how to do this	0
On your groups try to about how you fit those pieces in there	0
Yes	0
17 and then again a remainder	0
And your first one has to add your ending coordinates in it	0
Old photos	0
So if you could correct those thatd be great	0
Okay can I get you to pull that up	0
Yeah that 13 left over	0
Its not homework	0
All right yes	0
You can do that too	0
And then youre multiplying it by this number	0
I use the number to present that it is sixsided	0
Nice job	0
Okay	0
Absolutely	0
Four five six seven eight nine 10 16	0
Well go over it with you	0
Because seven eighths and three eighths would give you 10 eighths and you couldnt 10 eighths of a container of popcorn	0
Okay	0
Its not because I get it in my head its because I can use the fraction circles	0
Maybe	0
Right	0
I dont know where I got eight from	0
Go ahead and put that away	0
Arnold Palmer	0
Perfect so our number of piles is the exact same in both problems	0
Show me kneetoknee	0
If Im adding up one 63 plus 120 plus 101 those are all the buildings that we already know	0
Yeah Alicia	0
Thats great	0
Thank goodness for that	0
Put your pencils down please	0
Okay I want you to notice how you can figure this out just from the points six to negative three	0
If we look at type I dont know	0
Thats what its got to be if you write them in place value order that decimal lines up in order to make it easier to add	0
All right	0
Then I needed to color in 13	0
You dont have to whisper	0
Now this is something that I didnt see anybody in your work try to do	0
I want everyone to be able to explain it not just one in the group	0
I dont care	0
Ill put it back up there for another minute or two	0
So you will go in and just have to go to the lesson that I am teaching	0
Im sorry	0
Thats so cool	0
What if our pizza was cut into 12 slices	0
So theyre all kind of different lengths	0
Ill give you my take on that one in a second	0
So Dada do the first one	0
I know a even number you know my steps that I take	0
Six hundred eighty onethousandths round it to the nearest hundredth	0
Okay	0
All right	0
All right so so we agree 4	0
Oh its not having us	0
Writing equations is the trickiest part	0
It should be	0
I lied	0
Your name will be forever engraved	0
To do this you have to observe the box a little bit and see how you can find the length of this straw	0
Isosceles right triangle	0
I didnt see it	0
No	0
One two three four five six seven	0
So building number one plus building number two plus building number three plus building number four equals 472	0
Youre right	0
Also I will always ask you I would like you to be able to prove your answer	0
I have these problems for you	0
Three fourths	0
Im not adding them	0
So if I have 38 here	0
Okay	0
Yeah I want you to do these on your whiteboard	0
Or you can use your knowledge of your multiplication facts	0
Can you out it in the center	0
I can check on there	0
So lets talk about how much each person got	0
The area is one	0
Have a great day people	0
Then I would count and we have 56	0
Its a really good like math habit	0
Okay	0
The rest were other colors	0
Notes are posted every day for the lesson so you can review what we did in class again use that question Help button use advisory time and you can email me as well	0
You both know that its the first thing we  common denominator	0
Okay	0
Probably two thirds times two thirds	0
So thank you and thats it	0
And I Apolo make sure to write this page number	0
What question	0
I got distracted	0
So now you have this number and this number	0
And we have a ratio of one adult per five students	0
So its a whole minue a whole	0
They dont	0
So Gage Im going to stop sharing for just a second because I want you to look at my picture	0
Let me see	0
Do this one	0
So now we know the base	0
So remember to use number sense	0
Im doing that one	0
No	0
Theres our fair share	0
Yeah	0
Numerator	0
Okay	0
Okay were going to talk a lot about equations so dont worry too much if you got this one wrong	0
Okay	0
I will circulate for that one shortly	0
The what	0
OK Ill leave you to tell me	0
So its just like borrowing from the ones place or tenths place	0
If you need use your fractions circles you are welcome to	0
Look at it	0
Okay	0
hey don t put any   pebbles in yet glasses in yet	0
Completely alone	0
Perfect	0
Show	0
That would make my life way too Emmerson	0
You can also do a division line	0
Youre sharp	0
So you agree that	0
I think thats that is our lesson for today	0
And they want to know how many people how many more people live in that town than all the other ones combined	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
Tim homework	0
and well that youll set up inequality equations yourself and try to find the solutions	0
So a B is x squared plus x	0
You want us to try and figure it out the way I tried to figure  it out the first time	0
Were going to share some breakfast and we have groups	0
Yeah	0
Im gonna make some breakout rooms during those	0
Open it up	0
Thank you	0
We have to visualize the rest of it being in there	0
that one	0
Whenever you seeof would that just mean the two numbers you would multiply them	0
So if youre multiplying a number by a half youre going to have half as much as what you started with	0
Okay yes	0
First of all you finish that and show your work and explain your thinking	0
I know its Tuesday and it feels like Monday	0
Yeah but I want you to make one bigger than his	0
Eight times eight	0
And Ill say go work and so on and so forth	0
We got a little complicated there lets back up and lets simplify	0
Everybody give her a power clapOne two three clap	0
Mmhmm	0
On two	0
What	0
I want to talk about dollar a little bit	0
Lets see think everybodys got a great graph	0
Everybodys going to have a chance	0
Pick somebody to help you out	0
Okay and hold on just one	0
Hey crew as Im going around Im not seeing enough work from you guys	0
So were going to	0
Thats a big question mark	0
Luckily you should already know because I already taught it	0
Lets see what Audra thinks  the question is and then we can hear from those of you who  can try to help	0
Okay all right my friends	0
Like that	0
Youre welcome	0
And then if you feel confident in domain and range you can go ahead and try that out	0
They can still hear us	0
Producers make their own food	0
one piece of pizza each for each person	0
No but I figured out how	0
all the same okay so these are similar	0
That I cant figure out how it rounded it to its not making sense to me	0
Youre 100 right	0
I was over there with Blake and Ezra and we were looking at this its really got to be exact	0
Yeah that makes sense	0
Your boss is going to say get these numbers added and get them back to me as quick as you possibly can	0
And remember US traditional division is what your goal is	0
You got to be watching my hands	0
In order the answers are 2 6 6 2 2 and then 6	0
And then	0
Theyre my independent and dependent variables in this problem	0
Adam Dont get upset	0
A multiplication problem	0
Thank you	0
Go back and theres a next on the bottom	0
So well do 45 seconds per person	0
Friends you need to keep track of your Expo markers	0
Eyes on me everybody	0
Here Ill do them in order based on whats up here	0
We need math journals	0
We are going to check our work	0
I would say this isnt a mental math strategy but lets definitely check it this way	0
Erin	0
Y intercept	0
If Im rounding it to the nearest tenth I eliminate the hundredths and the thousandths	0
That means this is equal to that thats equal to that	0
Okay so you have two days to do homework 10	0
My daughters in second and can handle it	0
So this is reRamona important and this needs to be in your work	0
You want it to be right so go recount	0
Okay lets see where we left off in the list	0
Fraction whole number topic	0
Im not very good at doing it by heart	0
Okay friends go to number two	0
I see what you were doing	0
Thats good	0
Okay and then the graph will be super easy to make	0
Friends we do not talk during a fire drill ever	0
And that means that it goes up one over three or it goes up by a third of a box every time you go over one either one	0
I rewrote this problem as this one	0
My next group of four I would like Rory	0
I had plans but I never stuck to them	0
Youre going to have to think	0
All right	0
There I think you can read the last one too on the blackboard	0
Thats sixths	0
Okay	0
Uh somewhat	0
No	0
Ok so you did ten you called it ten and twenty because of the little  white ones	0
Add 40	0
We want to get this started	0
Some of you got a second model that showed something  different	0
Okay now I see a couple people try to write the equation	0
Thats how they listen to us	0
Discussions are fine but please do it in a whispering voice	0
Okay	0
When I have seven sixths	0
Go	0
You can also think of this as this	0
There you go	0
Im not convinced	0
Okay	0
You guys have a new appreciation for what teachers do	0
It s not it s never going to change	0
On Is it a linear function	0
Okay	0
Ive heard what Meredith  has to say	0
Think a bit now if this result that I have here I square it if I cant instead of taking he	0
Hm	0
And this is shape number three	0
Thats the way that our Earth stays healthy	0
Thanks for being here	0
Alright Sarah try to write that equation in	0
All right	0
Its 79	0
Oh	0
I just did it that way because you said	0
So I want to show you this slide	0
So here is where the mistakes are made	0
Yep	0
Oh	0
Okay	0
Then you start walking into the store	0
5 and 6 Estimate and then solve	0
No	0
Give one sheet of paper to another person	0
Zero two zero 10	0
Bye	0
Well do you remember from the previous the previous method of substitution you were trying to simplify two equations with two unknowns into one equation with one unknown	0
All right	0
So right now youre deciding of each of these four statements is true or false	0
Okay	0
Replace V with w plus one and were gonna then well have to solve but I think thats at least an easier way to start this problem	0
So that was like you could see his logic	0
I pulled them out	0
So then you can think about taking 24 and dividing it up into 4 groups	0
Wow I have other people named Ishmail in this class	0
Okay	0
We just just talked about it	0
No way	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Yes because you were in the State	0
Three two one	0
If I dont understand that do I have resources that I can go grab	0
And that came straight from my question	0
In this expression that becomes 65 yen	0
Thank you	0
And you shade them six 12 times because theres six in the 10ths place	0
You said that this was nine	0
And then I go vertical second	0
Q is the midpoint of segment PR	0
So arrange them so that you get the biggest quotient	0
Right	0
So let me just get math up really quickly	0
Okay	0
So I like that youre making the	0
Okay	0
Theyre breaking apart the people awesome	0
You have to know	0
Look how easy it was to rename that	0
You described it correctly but you wrote it wrong	0
Hi did you eat	0
Lets go back to our question now	0
Well no but but if were calling this fifty and there are each one in there  then its pretty much called a  fiftieth I guess	0
Otherwise no more whiteboards and Ill collect them all and I wont hand them out for a week	0
This is still Investigation 3 concepts so its a little bit more practice for that	0
And if x is six over here you have eight times six minus 12	0
Whatever the denominator is is what your whole is	0
I would love to hear from you but Im going to pass it to someone else and I want you to listen to see if you want to add anything else because you have done such as good job at explaining	0
Here we go	0
Two dark blue will fit on top of the yellow	0
Lets say youre going to add three dogs and two cats what label would your answer have	0
If you square that number you would double that amount of zeros	0
So now ah drive me crazy	0
No	0
Can you check exercise three for a moment	0
Im going to pause you	0
Sure	0
Once again regular polygon	0
Right perfect	0
Yes	0
I know that Ivana got it right and Wallace got it right	0
One two three show	0
Hey	0
Four thirds times 216	0
Because say I just put it on there	0
So Im going to write fivethirds over here for you	0
Ill turn  Okay	0
Kay heres your chance	0
Thirteen is prime	0
Um how did you do it the other day when you just clicked one of the things and it	0
That relates to uh this 3500 plus 120	0
One comma one	0
Write at least three down on your whiteboard and then stand up	0
Okay success criteria	0
I dont have to write 60080	0
So if someone spends 5 every week how much would they have spent in two weeks thats what kind of what I want you to think about for this	0
And then and then well take the quiz and then that will be it	0
The problem is four times 26	0
Did you guys already do thisDid you work all this Oh very good nice job friends	0
Right now I want you to think about this	0
alRight boys and girls um Im going to come back here because it just doesnt look right	0
841 if Im rounding it to the nearest hundredths it wouldnt be called onetenth	0
Person number two is going to share a different equivalent fraction and sit down equivalent to one	0
See whats happened here is you didnt start the next one there okay	0
Yeah	0
Okay	0
Your equation is y equals 3x plus one	0
Very good	0
Thank you very much	0
Come on	0
Excellent	0
When you complete that please continue with your math boxes	0
Now graph it over there	0
Oh I made a mistake	0
Okay	0
One hundred eighty yen	0
So first of all if the square of A is nine then you can write an equation	0
Lets focus in	0
It is	0
Yes it pushes the whole number up to the next	0
Okay	0
No	0
Now I could give you this	0
You should be done very quickly	0
Most of the time well leave it rounded to two decimal points	0
Here first thing isolate everything unknown on the same side	0
Thats fantastic	0
And 900 minus 773 cannot equal anything thats in the three hundreds	0
You try this right	0
Yes give me a second	0
As Lauren told us they are each very picky	0
Very good	0
I felt like the cast this morning	0
No no no no	0
So thats 47	0
Awesome	0
Im sorry someone had a question	0
Sorry	0
I couldnt even begin to tell you	0
Give you one more minute because I think theres a couple people that are still trying to finish up	0
Like my baloney has a first name its OSCAR Like that except this is a math name	0
The next tenth up would be zero and its going to round this one up	0
because this is just	0
We should be ready to share	0
So it started going by fours so it started going too long so it was that	0
Thats why were in school to learn	0
You may	0
36	0
These are models	0
You shouldve known the other two	0
Yes	0
Thank you Karla	0
Okay so now youre going to write her new rule	0
I think a lot of you had part of this done but you didnt think about the entire problem	0
Because the answer youre aiming for	0
And do we have to write	0
So its pretty close to one and a half	0
Were going at least 10 times	0
So these would not be the same	0
So we are under 1	0
Dont say that	0
Okay Travis Im going to wait three two one page 201 zero	0
Next I would be doing I would be trying harder than this if I was a student right	0
Interesting	0
I promise well use our whiteboards	0
We dont know how many carrots he had	0
Im gonna give you 30 seconds	0
Sides	0
It is more than just 14 this is 16	0
So AB is equal to 20	0
Good	0
If I have 31 thousandths I should have zero tens threehundredths and onethousandths to put those together	0
Kind of interesting	0
You get a lot of food and my family whenever we go I like it because my mom lets me get anything I want there because she loves Costco  Im spending a lot more time and money and	0
Then just take a screenshot	0
I do to the bottom	0
And then it goes down also each time	0
And if its bigger for the I round it up to 30	0
That means opposite	0
All right here we go	0
okay	0
And yours might look different	0
Can you send Caroline to the office for an appointment	0
Okay	0
You may have time just for number two	0
Once again the dog says for every eight tricks I complete I get 24 treats and the cat thats my ratio of treats to tricks is 16 to four	0
Yeah its almost	0
Two	0
Awesome	0
While you two are working on that Im going to give directions on what I want you to do	0
Now the subtraction problem number two	0
And eight times zero is zero	0
And you have 10 family members	0
Its been bent too many times	0
So Matt it has to be labeled outside the box because inside the box is where you would do your multiplication work	0
So dont have to like overdo it on this one	0
Yeah	0
All right	0
When I went talk	0
I expect number sentence a visual model and an accurate answer quotient	0
I know there will be some	0
I know	0
Then put the extra dark blue piece next to it  and now we have our 38	0
So here is what that means	0
When I am doing a graph X coordinate Y coordinate	0
Then your last one is 5 divided by 4	0
Okay	0
And were gonna take a break	0
Youre saying Asher that these two pieces are the same and one of these	0
You see it shows the tangent of the sine when you show the tangent of the sine the sine of the tangent is shown	0
If you cant find a partner let me know	0
Are you guys	0
Yes were talking about reading your directions right	0
H double prime	0
Right	0
Thank you  today	0
Okay so lets look	0
Well know what youre up to	0
If were dividing one third into two parts it might look like this	0
Okay which is 82	0
Okay	0
Very good	0
mentioned some of what went on	0
22 wont 23 wont	0
I wanted to show you guys a video about meerkats	0
So 1 for four ounces	0
You checked all of them and none of them worked	0
Were talking about angle 62 here	0
Give yourself a check or an X for each part	0
Just know that yellow is a tough one to read	0
There we go	0
So now we know that her cruffins were 52 cents each	0
Can it be chocolate	0
Mrs Dominic brought in a breakfast casserole to celebrate her fifth grades class good behavior	0
Hand the pencil and the colored pencil to the other person	0
Ms Davies	0
Im gonna make you keep using the fraction circles	0
Sure	0
Okay	0
Day two is gonna get 123	0
Yes	0
Youre exactly right	0
Ill give you one more minute	0
If we go back to our problem we can say the sixth grade class is going to go yurt camping	0
No	0
Then 16 26 36 46 56	0
Anderson you have the first part try the second part	0
That works well for me thank you	0
The lengths	0
Justice judge those things you re proving your case to them	0
So if you do not	0
Or sorry Im asking that backwards	0
Hm	0
Can I join the class of Harley in that case	0
Could you have Ms  call 5208 please	0
If youre doing work off to the side the whole point is that youre working on your ratio table	0
All right	0
Youll know if youre right	0
Lets see if we can do it the oldfashioned way the way Ive been teaching you with math rather than manipulatives	0
If it slows you down I dont want you to do that	0
Do we have to write out the question Miss	0
Whats the name of the street	0
By yourself	0
Okay so one	0
All right	0
In order to do so I will draw two straight lines which have a distance of two unit squares	0
Lets move on	0
Okay	0
Now before we do anything else I want to look at these and weve been practicing our benchmark percents	0
So now were going to put this on a ratio table	0
Ok	0
We can continue with this	0
So I also need to multiply 2x2 to get to 4	0
I didnt say erase your boards	0
Well so Charlie apparently you need to come with me this afternoon too cuz youre gonna retake this	0
I thought if you If you took people and divide it by the number of houses I thought that would be finding average	0
Okay	0
Tim thank you	0
Usually on Fridays I have some happy hours left since on Fridays Im sitting here until 11 oclock in the evening anyway	0
Yes	0
I would like someone to put negative up by the number	0
What do you think the number story	0
First and foremost Kingslyers down erase your boards clean lids on your Kingslyers erasers down	0
And theres no blocks that have half on them and for the  uneven numbers for the odd numbers you need a half because  you cant make it without it	0
So we are done with our success criteria I dont nope were done with that	0
You cant be like Ooh I really like that	0
Diego is cutting off the pages	0
The problem said that in all he used 9 cups of each ingredient	0
Awesome	0
That would be the counting up method thats counting up subtraction	0
Okay	0
This one I want you to do to the estimate without the problems	0
So you meant longer and wider as the same thing	0
So its going to be this one and this one and this one and this one	0
Im only on number one	0
So we need to do 180 minus 165 which is 15	0
Otherwise we did something wrong	0
Deal	0
Hold on	0
Think back to the MathXL	0
Awesome	0
Yeah those are the two colors that you used	0
Nothing too crazy	0
We ll talk more about it someday	0
The home team wins the other sixteen of the games	0
I can change grids to represent and solve decimal addition and subtraction problems	0
No were not throwing markers back and forth	0
And that ones also perfect	0
Okay	0
Thats your very first problem	0
Thats a mouthful	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
Yeah	0
Yes thats right	0
Then we use the three to take it time eight and thats 24 plus four is 28	0
Really do some thinking because Im going to ask you to justify	0
I love that I have people looking back	0
So thats good	0
Click Okay after each coordinate or click Clear to start over	0
Were interpreting	0
Can I go to the bathroom	0
Because that is part of a multiplication in the equation it doesnt say that you have to multiply two X squared by something	0
We usually do	0
and I got 74	0
We did that on Wednesday and then we reviewed our work on Friday	0
But yes this is 50	0
So the rise is two	0
This is where your problem	0
And the W stands for the	0
On probably Thursday Ill give you one thats a little bit more complicated	0
Oh Adam	0
But obviously that would make this too simple	0
Take a break if you need it	0
Do you have partners at your team	0
All right	0
It doesnt matter	0
Well there might be	0
Because I just need the BME really teeny tiny	0
Its just like this	0
I would want water just period	0
Were not adding them all	0
So theres a special pattern here that I want us to see	0
Set up a ratio table	0
And thats going to give us seven is equal to 2x minus five	0
Im gonna highlight in yellow the domain	0
Thanks sweetie	0
You may go	0
Thats how we did that first part	0
okay	0
Were going to have to find something that matches up like this	0
Youre doing the ones that I told you to do	0
This is one fourth two fourths and this is three fourths	0
Okay	0
That would be	0
Okay	0
Go grab your ruler for a straight edge	0
Oh	0
Okay hum let s get the paper passed out and let s try that	0
Excellent	0
It is the equilateral polygon and also equiangular polygon	0
Its 24	0
Very good	0
Oh	0
All right	0
Write it down on your whiteboard	0
Well I think we ve run out of time	0
Lets see what you think	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Now Verizon was a little trickier  because all of a sudden here Reese we have whats called an upfront cost	0
Yes	0
You have your own dot in a color	0
Yes	0
A fourth of the two and a half	0
I dont think he understand the problem	0
ad they thought there would be the same	0
Red angle purple side	0
Im going to use Izzy as an example here	0
Were going to do four first and then we will discuss	0
Stop that	0
Thumb up if you have your partner next to you someone youre sitting really close by	0
So we won three games out of four	0
We will explore rotation iteration of measurement units and angle measures	0
It says its 941 AM	0
Kyra make sure you simplify that fraction	0
Okay	0
Yes I kept it Samantha in the Listen write this down on your white sheet that we did height on and forearm length	0
Sure	0
Option B is that you get 30 off first so you have to figure out what 30 of 150 is or you could do 70 of it what youre going to pay	0
Okay warm out those hands so that we dont have any injuries	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Um ok its doubled because it now it has four oranges and two  purples or a brown so	0
The 2 times the 50 and the 2 times the 6	0
Then	0
Well you you can see that here is two A	0
Quickly	0
You know that s definitely false	0
3	0
And the reason why is because youre going from negative one	0
For B Im thinking of a number	0
Insurance is due Wednesday	0
And these are the five big subtopics thatre going to be covered on the final exam	0
So what so you have to divide 408 dollars in the ratio of 200 to four	0
In fact I would excuse you from writing the story in question one if if you wanted to just say divide 60 in the ratio of five to three you could just write it as a ratio	0
From the same whole	0
So we know that it was even all the way through so its a straight line and then going backwards you get negative two and negative five	0
Notice how whatever we do to the top we also have to do to the bottom	0
Yeah	0
Always youre going to do is explain why you redid this	0
Okay so A uh square of A equals nine	0
Yes	0
I dont want you to erase lids on your markers	0
Theyre not the same denominator	0
If two angles of one triangle are the same as two angles on the other triangle then the triangles are similar	0
Not really	0
I mean 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 3 plus 10 plus 9 equals 82	0
Please continue that down	0
Shaila homework	0
All right	0
No	0
So Im going to ask you each to identify what part you are struggling with	0
Could you show that in the back there once again	0
All right	0
2170 is what I got	0
Yes	0
Well you might be	0
Problem four on 124	0
This one down here	0
So were gonna work on it	0
Box times box minus fourteen times box plus thirteen equals zero	0
Circle the rule for sailboat four	0
I just cant tell from your picture	0
So Im going to see if I can divide them by three	0
Sorry	0
Pardon	0
Shading is good but there is one other one Im thinking of	0
I am just going to move on to the next screen	0
All right	0
Ahh it is hard	0
Yes okay	0
It doesnt matter how you split it up just as long as its all the same answer	0
Make an illegal substitution that produces a false statement	0
Okay	0
Like it says over there the rise in this case is down two the run is one so your slope is negative two	0
If you are somewhere where you are distracted and cant concentrate then maybe you and your partner need to move somewhere else	0
This is congruent to that now	0
We write our twelfths	0
First then next right there	0
Thank you	0
I want to make that my number line	0
Um with a protractor	0
Four  so a 12 equals 48	0
All right so for the first one show me	0
Okay so on the right side these cancel out and we get equals zero	0
Were going to  be watched forever and ever Hunter	0
But I want you to notice that this part with the N is your slope this part after the N is your y intercept	0
Do quadrillion	0
I agree 100 with that	0
Okay	0
So thats going to help you answer the  the patterns of the data and then the strengths of her solution	0
Yeah	0
67 hundreds	0
If you got 5994 congratulations you are right I was wrong	0
Okay	0
Some people are okay adding Well it helps if you	0
Because  so I knew that two was two wholes	0
I found that problem is for number 5	0
18 but your picture does not match because what your picture is telling me is that youve divided those into six	0
This one round this decimal to the nearest one  Round this one to the nearest 10th Im seeing some different answers here I said 10th nearest 10th	0
And my decimal is going to be that I have two wholes and eight tenths	0
You cant bring it with you	0
Yep	0
That one looks good	0
Okay	0
Okay thats good	0
Next problem you get to choose what strategy you want to use	0
Well were not	0
So all the way down he did that	0
As our numerator	0
One half	0
Number five A D	0
Sure	0
Ill help you guys draw your diagram	0
All right	0
Were going to come to a consensus on the best way to solve these and look at how the best way is to write an equation	0
Beautiful	0
But you dont have to	0
All right then	0
Thats this point right here	0
Would you pass one to each person please	0
Yeah youre exactly right	0
now	0
Which is bigger a half or two thirds	0
Youre on the Avery train right now	0
In your current unit	0
And what Ive done is I have given away each of them got 3 10s because I know that three times or five times three equals 15	0
Its just 8100 bigger than 12	0
Stop	0
Gonna be This one	0
I wasnt understanding	0
See if it helps you with number one	0
Just a minute	0
Put it in the drawer	0
So basically whats happening slice thats missing on the but youre just missing one tiny slice versus	0
They seem to be the same words	0
Did you realize	0
All the ways to remember what an innie versus an outtie looked like	0
Yes you may draw it again	0
Im not saying you couldnt eventually figure it out but when I say do it in your head that means do it right away	0
Now I will with the other four triangles I have I will make the other one	0
Okay	0
So the first one she did 100 times 10	0
You might turn in your homework and I would say Oh my gosh you only partially did your homework	0
Sort of a general one in here n choose x	0
One two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12	0
Put it in your backpack	0
I cant say that they dont understand how to do the math just because I cant see it	0
Im going to use my stemandleaf plot and Im going to count stemandleaf plot	0
Alan and Meredith have tried and not convinced Bryan	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
That just means that Im doubling it	0
Triangle	0
Even better exactly	0
That confirms that theres no yintercept	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Erik is suggesting  above it	0
Yes you could also do it in parentheses	0
Look at the data	0
Uhm	0
Was it warmer	0
You guys are so smart	0
Yeah	0
Look at the pattern	0
For every week the number of money in dollars goes down by five	0
You were right on that one	0
So how many twelfths where are your twelfth pieces	0
Ms  what page is it	0
So those of you who are at that point looks great	0
You need to solve with the pieces	0
Okay	0
Ooh	0
The length of each rug needs to be seven yards long and eight yards long	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Yeah I dont think we did	0
You need to stay at your desks for this	0
And then were also looking for how much it goes up by each time	0
Okay and then down by one and a half again you get negative 15	0
You found the treasure and heres how many points you earned	0
Hello	0
The middle week the second week of this unit we worked on for dash four and four dash five	0

Im splitting it up into eighths because Im trying to find 58 of 34	0
I heard the first I didnt hear the answer	0
One one one one one	0
Awfully quiet	0
So an equivalent ratio is there are two squares for every one circle	0
Thats thats what its asking you to to write down about	0
So you separated the fractions and the whole numbers and solved from there	0
So Im going to switch my camera and show you what the problem is	0
Write it on your slates	0
Because were trying to figure out how much of the large container is a small container	0
The group I worked with we got it	0
Four	0
Im going to give 51 out to you first	0
Ms Cornish Can I add all my numbers up	0
What	0
Okay could we get it quiet for a second I want to make sure	0
What	0
I want you rounding the numbers to the nearest tens	0
Just towards him	0
Thats just how it is	0
Clearly not	0
Theyre very quick surveys literally two questions	0
You can use the clock to make different angles and so Im going to just show you one	0
Okay	0
You got it	0
Were getting close	0
That is such a great tool to use	0
Yes	0
Oh  Mr Callouses on the happy juice apparently	0
All right lets say for Avorys dress I need 1 and 23 of yard of fabric	0
I was going to ask if could share how I did it	0
So because those are similar because those are the same proportion That side angle side similarity these triangles are similar	0
Yes thats perfect	0
So your final answer here is 12 and 1924	0
Three two one zero	0
There you go so its no yes yes	0
That gets rid of ps from that side	0
Compared to the smaller brothers	0
Mmmm hmmm	0
Yeah	0
Im sorry to bother you I just have a question	0
Thank you	0
So we need to write down those words	0
Okay	0
Drop it in	0
Okay so online take a couple minutes see what you can do with these problems	0
3rd one is between two and three	0
Mike	0
And then remember you cant divide by 0	0
What you did Elyse was great	0
So you should have your math journal open	0
Youll have to take some lessons in college	0
So when we look at a number story Ben thank you	0
Yeah	0
Ill give you to write your name on this one and then when you turn in the paper that you and your partner are going to do you are going to look at what youve done on the rubric and explain if you dis or why you agree	0
And then to extract	0
So keep making those guesses	0
You are out of  please	0
three quarters and if you take one of the twelfths and you put it  down here it fits	0
And we are talking about place values	0
Connect the points in the same order that you plot them	0
Yeah	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Alright	0
Can you plug that monitor	0
You cannot have it not lined up this is not correct	0
So all right let me let me test you here	0
But instead of doing two calculations try to see if you could do it with a single one	0
It says without graphing find the equation of the line that goes through each pair of points	0
So one other word that Id like you to know for today is relation	0
They told you	0
But they didn t they called the dark green one Erik	0
52 cents each	0
Ms Koski if I was to keep going in this lesson I was going to have them have a different partner for number one and then do Pairs Compare like Stand up	0

So we have three and six here	0
That works	0
Three plus three plus three plus three and not know that three times four is 12	0
Yes	0
1 120	0
Now were just going to write the algorithm for one more	0

All right	0
Ok they dont  need quite that many	0
I want to hear what Michael has to say	0
No	0
Aubrey you were correct you just needed to reduce it	0
Then thats an example Ill talk about	0

And this is five H	0
Good	0
So I want you to notice how we have a whole number and we have a fraction here	0
I dont think Nicole does	0
Constant terms both are the same ten	0
Theres like three or four questions in there where I linked the answer into the question because its not a self grading question	0
You keep calling her Maggie	0
Okay so on your paper I want you write these steps	0
You are doing equivalent fractions using the rule	0
I want to make sure that we at least get through this one before we keep going	0
If my rule over here works we should find a pattern here	0
And Im going to show you how else you can find it	0
I know but why is it called Well why is it six	0
Stella show me	0
Hold them up	0
All right	0
Look at that	0

Were going to try to work through this one then well keep going	0
So you can	0
This is what were focusing on today	0
Now I agree with that for the denominators	0
Thats kind of hard to see because here because it doesnt have any squares underneath	0
This is a little tougher	0
All right	0
One last part	0
Slope is four	0

Pass it back as it is upside down okay	0
So we did five times one equals five	0
So what youre suggesting is multiplying by 8 didnt  work	0
So we are going to to calculate those sides we will also use the diagram	0
sorry to page 71	0
Even those of you that are advanced you still use multiplication to help you solve division	0
Hey come on up	0
Okay	0
3x8	0
This is a one	0
If you need the auxiliary lines the problem is what kind of auxiliary lines should you use	0
And then two and a half more	0
We have another 6	0
Well you cant distribute that negative in there so watch the analysis here	0
So you are going to open your maths memo to page 131	0
If it tells me to divide it I need to divide all of it	0
Think about what you can maybe do next	0
No that one is two	0
Can we clear all the stuff in it	0
Good	0
Yes as long as youre doing it that is fine	0
Youre missing the conversation when youre drawing and then when youre scribbling on your board	0
And were going to draw a picture that represents just this first sentence	0
Other than that you are going to have an extra six minutes six and a half minutes here at the end of class	0
So 50 youre just going to take half of those values because half of 100 is 50	0

Right	0
So because this isnt actually two one thousands	0
There are  some people who didnt raise their hands either way	0
I will know Im successful when I can apply one of the strategies practiced in this lesson on problems two and four on page 170	0
Yes I I think so	0
Okay	0
So just know that your slope is two	0
Yes Im not sure	0
Yes	0
Please	0
When I redo this Im going to do exactly	0
or the number of times that something occurs	0
Long division is just like partial quotients in this where after I subtract I start over with this new number that I created	0
Lets see	0
Okay now lets look at the run	0
10	0
Alright ok so that would work	0
Alayna who is your partner at your table with you	0
You can do this on your own triple it	0
Excellent job my friends	0
Because the end number an odd number	0
Fine	0
Okay	0
Our next one is describe what you think the new picture will look like	0
Its going to be more than one	0
Okay	0
Thinking about what do I know about 45 times nine	0
We know that our denominator has to be a six	0
And then thats a half plus a fourth or 34ths of a  whole sandwich they dont get a whole sandwich if theres only three	0
Give her a round of applause	0
Okay looks great	0
I want you to plot this	0
What people who are really successful in these kind of assignments do is they make a little record in their math notebook	0
Art lets keep the comments to ourselves thank you	0
Now Lacy do you have that down	0
17 comes along closes it	0
Its a root of 1024 plus 2016	0
Well well see if you understand	0
Okay	0
I made it	0
So first thing is youre going to try and youre going to put forth effort you are going to apply problem solving strategies	0
Put your boards down	0
One through nine	0
Maybe this ones better	0
So this is another example of why it wont work	0
Put this paper to the side	0
Without peeking inside thanks	0
I dont have a sticky note	0
Two	0
Should I do it like this	0
For those friends who are really trying hard to show advanced thinking you have to actually show probably the correct answer what could work	0
Okay	0
Now if you want to draw a line down to separate them you can	0
Okay	0
Okay one two three	0
You have the ones place thats counting down nine eight seven six five	0
Okay	0
See Vijay my job isnt as easy as it seems	0
Im seeing five hands	0
You get rid of one of the threes	0
You already did your 21 so you do not have to redo it	0
We have zero wholes and we have eight out of 10 pieces or parts	0
I think everybody is well agreed on that	0
We want a common multiple	0
She punched in an incorrect number	0
Its very purposeful	0
Wait was it 134 or 135	0
I was looking around looking at rules	0
All right	0
Yes	0
Ali proved it with pictures	0
Or youll have a formula and will have to figure it out	0
So just so everyone knows after this question were going to take about a three minute break	0
So youd go farther across and still go the same height	0
Ill recommend two things	0
Times two	0
It would be a different number but thats why I would go from 400 to 40 and just do one thats really easy that you dont have to do any work to the side	0
Here the biggest question is that this is two this is one this is three and this is two	0
And then you three	0
After	0
I want you to notice the place value set up my multiples over here	0
So are we going to be doing powers of 10 for the past week	0
It is important in the place holder and in the place value	0
It goes in the truth set that makes it true	0
I hope that by the end of our unit that you love them as much as I do	0
And you are deconstructing the prompt so I want you to read this really carefully	0
So one four is fine	0
But what Erik just told me  right is something about red and white	0
So lets think about how we would turn that into a fraction now	0
Shhh voices are off	0
One you had 146 in your piggy bank	0
Im just gonna do those three	0
And then well see if we agree or not	0
P V C P V C	0
So if you subtract one of the numbers from this number from the total number then you get the remaining number	0
My question was what to start with here	0
Don t all answer at once	0
So I need to make sure you can multiply two numbers with decimals accurately	0
All right	0
Ok we will hear Kelly and Jackie and we will hear Brian s again	0
Four hundreds	0
So lets look at our assignment for today so I want you to get your math journal please	0
If you have any missings make sure that you email me	0
Lets go	0
Right but now were doing three quarters and two thirds	0
Okay	0
But if you said angle x that means you could be talking about this angle it means you could be talking about this angle	0
You just have to show me	0
I forgot to ask if we agree	0
All right and theyre supposed to be the same	0
Youre on the right track	0
Gabby what do you do when you and your partner are finished	0
Okay so side one lets make it really short	0
Im going to revisit my thinking box up here	0
You now make sevenfifty an hour	0
Well down below it is negative they run parallel to one another so they must have the same slope	0
Not in the recipe but there could be	0
A mayor is the head of the executive branch for a city and the president is the head of the executive branch for a country	0
Oh	0
Apollo call in someone else to give me the next step	0
You do not need to go back and do this page again	0
If you are in math land if you want to hang on two seconds I will also share it with you in the link	0
Ordered pairs are always in parentheses	0
Well let you squeeze it in there this time	0
Each ribbon we want to be a  half meter long	0
Ill give you a suggestion in a second	0
Hm	0
Okay	0
Okay take out your textbook	0
Could I sit there for a second	0
four	0
Let me see	0
Eyes over here	0
Oh nice	0
Explain what youre doing	0
One two	0
It is as neat as I can possibly make it	0
Like he said it does snow in some parts of California	0
I started by Friend put your mask on	0
Yeah	0
Yeah	0
Any of your methods were pretty good	0
It should have been	0
That was how we got our answer	0
Everybody just pick up your board	0
If you have a confusion you have two other people who are really happy to help you out	0
Mhmm	0
Then remember to add	0
Okay	0
Youve done a multiplication and a subtraction at the same time	0
All right Now we are ready	0
So it tells you to go back there	0
Very good	0
Okay	0
What can you do if you dont understand the problem	0
To figure out how much more we have left	0
Okay	0
I need you all to get out your note catchers and fines	0
Oh he says	0
Oh Demi	0
But	0
Yeah	0
Height	0
34ths	0
So it may be for you	0
10 minutes and then we will be back for writing	0
No	0
I dont want anybody answering this	0
So in your table here I want you to think of some ways that you can categorize these dinosaurs	0
Firstly everyone just individually read through the page please	0
Do the two of you have math you need to be doing	0
Four twentyeight as sigma F X	0
Then thats what you would answer	0
Okay	0
I was looking for tummy in its stomach	0
Yes it would be our fifth piece of data	0
Please	0
Good	0
Next to it write number one	0
That is clear concise and specific	0
We learned yesterday that you need to make sure that you use labels so that if somebody looks at this they can read what your diagram is	0
Four and four goes into 200 nice and easily	0
Ok it looks as if everyone did	0
I saw some really good rules but I want us to think how does this relate to equivalent fractions	0
I think this would be a great time to use your common denominator strategy	0
I dont know how to add	0
Five pieces in this one but Im filling in four	0
No	0
This is like a long one	0
Jadas is 30 minutes and Dallass is 24	0
I want to see what you guys get for your answer there	0
Okay	0
And on page 53	0
The link screen is this	0
Okay	0
So the half would have to be in the same place	0
If I fold this card exactly in half I can see that the median is 4 but my mean score is different	0
People it looks like we are pretty much all set up	0
Okay	0
Our learning and intention for today	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
So multiplying fractions is a pretty straight forward process	0
Okay lets go to the next one	0
No it just meant that we have to make sure were looking at things relevant to what use theyre going to serve	0
Still waiting	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
You already have one	0
You already have the information	0
Okay	0
This involves	0
What some people have done is they review it with me during advisory that works out great	0
Your teachers when youre drawing things in preschool	0
This one comes from here	0
If you just listed on the test were going to give you a window to list them	0
Were going to compare earth with the final image number two	0
Table four it goes down by three every time x goes up by two y goes down by three so it should look like this and then your equation will be this and like I said dont worry about the equation too much for right now were going to come back to this after this	0
Okay so if I split this in half first and then in fourths	0
Im going to write this problem right up here and were going to go through each of our steps	0
Number two on your textbook	0
So all we need to do for qR is say its 41	0
I had  theres a way to um connect that and binary numbeTeacher together	0
Okay	0
And then you Mr Parker patiently wait	0
And then we did the mapping diagram	0
But yeah okay good connection	0
So if you havent already saved you need to save it at this stage	0
I cant find this slide	0
Sometimes coordinate grids connect lines that go way far out and help us interpret data	0
So heres some cool things about multiplication because you have a great idea also	0
From this one you could	0
Okay	0
Thank you	0
Start by folding it in half	0
Six 10ths	0
notice the three is M So thats right here gets multiplied by x and then the B is two	0
Right now	0
Kate is ready	0
I was hoping someone would say area models	0
No you dont have to show it to me right now	0
Oh thats good	0
The answer to the mathematical equation would be four	0
Were about ready to leave now	0
With the compass	0
We figured out one package costs 50 that was our first step	0
This is the one you should be working on	0
So lets set up a ratio table with the information we have so far	0
Thank you	0
Graph that	0
Sure	0
Eight and two thousand nine hundred thirtyeight thousandths	0
Im actually going to turn the camera off	0
No	0
Its if you can show	0
I have to make them the same or else its not going to work	0
So the surface area is 50 times H	0
And you divide by two	0
It doesnt say that 15 is 120 so it doesnt go up there	0
Good	0
Just your estimate buddy	0
Standard notation	0
A quotient is the answer to a division problem	0
We dont have anybody whos is a half of a foot tall or half an inch tall	0
The player with the larger fraction wins the round and takes all the cards	0
You guys are going to have to explain your thinking	0
Kalen youre getting fancy with seeing what decimals will do for you	0
They are really equal in size but they stick a bit	0
Kayla who are you working with	0
Talk about that for 30 seconds and write down the answers	0
Okay	0
Absolutely	0
Im going to line up my zeros on the end and then Im going to put my 12 so thats 120	0
I want you to try the whole row	0
Thats right	0
You guys when you answer I need you to stand up just so I can make sure that we can hear you	0
So in this case now we dont know 99 times 50	0
That would be um sixtysix	0
We go to problems	0
Right there is fine	0
Today were going to be doing a little bit more critical thinking	0
Which question did I tell you to do	0
All right now were gonna jog in place	0
Sorry I was confused	0
Like this line and like this use auxiliary lines and try drawing it	0
Im going to replace this B with a seven	0
When I was teaching fourth grade I gave all my fourth graders a multiplication test and I said do as many as you can in one minute	0
A M	0
You are deconstructing a math problem a math reading	0
Now this is exactly what is called a term X plus Y minus Z	0
Okay	0
So thats this entire segment	0
I want you to work on number two and three with your partner and then give me a hero	0
Yeah	0
Is she a queen	0
We can see that information for each of our parts in our ratio table	0
It came out	0
We reflected it so now its kind of in a different position	0
Yes	0
Similar to partial products	0
Aint that weird	0
No	0
Technical difficulties starting where we left off on the last video	0
I need to go back and see what the numbers were	0
Ah	0
Yeah	0
But I would  like you all to listen to these arguments	0
The measures end up being half of whatever those two sums are	0
So if you look at what they did they did 74	0
That means that we need a total of 130 bars	0
Some reminders and announcements for you	0
So one way you might describe this would be you multiply all the number parts or all the number of terms	0
When youre coloring the 25 you have to come all the way down and it what comes here is that you colored in 25 here	0
All right	0
Youre not supposed to know what it looks like	0
Yes	0
Asher try it	0
I know we like to work with our friends but we should work with a different partner all that time	0
So youve already got equals	0
It didnt get stretched and made all the way bigger it just only got wider	0
We know two ways to do this	0
Well	0
Okay so lets draw a picture and explain what this means in words	0
They have a five here	0
The first five multiples of nine	0
And then to make sure we have it right it should be one two three four five six one two three four five six	0
Three sixty minus X	0
Okeydokey	0
Okay	0
We ve got some so we ve got some where there are two numbers and some where there is only one number	0
Exactly	0
Oh like if you just type something in the chat and then highlight it	0
I would like you to turn me to me and I would like you to talk through this first problem	0
Okay so were going to create equivalent fractions which you guys have done before	0
Watch	0
My mistake	0
Okay	0
Well Id have to do some calculation to know that thats correct but if they count it back to me then I know that its correct	0
So if we know we have 24 and we say okay divided by groups of eight thats three	0
Yes Im really  interested in this	0
Oh look at all my cheaters looking at their notes look at all my cheaters  looking at their notes	0
But if you remember my lesson with Mrs  class I said we want to get away from that thinking	0
Okay	0
Lets solve it together	0
I just want to say I appreciate Camilla for holding James accountable and saying how did you get that	0
Now  Oops that didnt work	0
200x5 is 1000	0
Ill need it again in a minute	0
So this would be a symmetrical drawing which is very important for what were going to talk about today because it means that whatever you see on the left side you see on the right side because this is a holistic thing	0
Im not going to try the 112	0
u is the middle point because it says u is the midpoint	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Im going to go old school	0
Yeah	0
You can ask them questions but you do not get to start sharing until your turn shows up on the timer	0
Yes	0
Thats the total	0
You could just write 1 and 2 and you could say 12	0
Alexander move to your spot	0
I can do one better	0
You didnt need to connect so you can look at these and tell where theyre wrong	0
Eight 16 24 42 48	0
So just do a finish that that time exercise	0
You might take your white ribbon to see if it s this long	0
Okay	0
Sorry x plus x minus six	0
Mr Sassy	0
Show down	0
Weve got these sides are congruent	0
So like I said thats what cool about this is Elyse way worked perfectly so did this one	0
So friends um can you see my board over here	0
Were getting a new house so were looking for new furniture	0
That is a number	0
All right Catherine	0
I want you to just watch	0
Well 40 of these like to free draw and 50 of these like to free draw are boys  figure it out	0
Youre going to have to work without questions for a few minutes I guess  because I still got some  stuff	0
Okay	0
Okay thats going to be it for today	0
Okay about 30 more seconds and then well talk about these	0
I dont know what seeing out there	0
I was up to 6	0
But when I lets when I split those in fifths this is what I got	0
Yeah	0
Thats just what pi means	0
On the left side of the blackboard I have instead of lengths put up these colored paper sheets	0
You can just do this with a partner	0
All right crew lets check out number two	0
Think about the reason were learning decimals	0
Adding K to the original measures of center	0
Yes	0
Okay so we didnt solve it though Landon	0
Okay	0
Red	0
Perimeter we said is base plus base plus height plus height	0
twice the same bracket as factors	0
Were going to talk a little bit about some money right now	0
So I want everyone to get their 14 so one of their 14	0
Solve it then	0
There are 172 sixth graders and the state park requires a ratio of 1 adult chaperone to every 5 students okay	0
Thank you	0
Okay	0
Good	0
Well thats a very good question	0
Yeah it will	0
I see you have a  No	0
You got it	0
So add 13 plus 13	0
Nw friends my goal is that this will in the end make us more efficient meaning were solving problems quickly correctly and with the least amount of steps	0
And we made that table there right	0
Were looking for a quart	0
Okay I think we get this	0
All right	0
Its really focusing on graphs	0
Hey girls	0
Im going to have you bring your driving spots back over to the carpet	0
She snatched it from me	0
All right	0
Go ahead and work on three and four	0
Keep your fourteen together perhaps if you keep the  fourteen together then just get another group for me	0
Okay that s a different  problem a brand new problem	0
Okay	0
No there is only one fraction	0
Five feet	0
And youre taking nine from 63 which you would not get so far from that	0
Thats what you should be discussing as a team	0
Were going to start with this	0
No because we need the set up	0
Okay	0
Each carton contains one dozen	0
We are using the main strategy to add and to track to balance the main statement	0
Thats really what the lesson is for today	0
You just got to deal with decimals	0
You know what lets do one and three	0
Your next step is to turn this into an improper fraction	0
First yellow tile	0
For nine I would do eight then I would multiply the number by two and then I would subtract two and then I would add three	0
Even though its not from this point to this point its really the same thing	0
Yeah	0
The opposite of multiplication	0
All right the rest of you go ahead and take them and put them in your blue folders	0
I think you got it now	0
Oh Lord	0
So that was equal groups	0
So you have access to those	0
So what Im going to ask of you right now is Im gonna ask that you make any mathematical corrections or additions to Student As paper and make sure at the bottom of the page that you give reasons why you made those additions or changes	0
Like if you have ten candy bars	0
Its opposite	0
How do you think Parjeet should place her cards to get the largest possible quotient	0
Its just that quadratic equations are not always of this kind	0
Well no actually I like this way	0
I put my dot closer to the zero because I thought 13 16ths are more than a half so Ive got to delete a half so I put it more near to zero	0
Our first place value is the ones tens and so forth	0
You are not helping her	0
Thatll be a great idea	0
Okay	0
The problem gets a little bit tricky but its the trick	0
Okay all right now get it this is going to be the complete opposite	0
Eleven thirds	0
Now I want you to think really carefully about what it means for the slope to be two	0
Lets go up here	0
We are obliged	0
Okay	0
So you can kind of like be a little bit strategic about that	0
Because if you have thirds you would be dividing that  into three parts so you could put it in three different  places	0
Sure	0
Come up here yes	0
Did you know those dark markings act like sunglasses allowing the meerkats to see in the harsh desert life	0
So lets try	0
I would like to just remind you that homework has a purpose	0
All right lets take a look at the math journal	0
I think there are too many people who are standing up and moving around  of their snack	0
But he wants to buy two sets of strings	0
When I look at my values I see that I have the household that was six people I have one that was five people I have one that was three	0
12	0
That is possible	0
Yes	0
Okay all right	0
and four eight zero	0
Take a minute	0
I know youre not	0
Remember how one of our rights is that we all have the right to have a clean and quiet classroom and a place to work	0
Im going to stop you right there	0
Yep	0
Mm hmm	0
Thats what you know about four thirds of land	0
So representations are used to prove or to help	0
Now not everyone had a prediction that the total was going to be 360	0
Im confused on sentence four	0
Hold your hands up	0
And so that was things like y equals mx plus b	0
During the summer Julie read five times as many books as Julie Julie read eight books	0
I saw some Bs talking	0
No	0
And Felix youre close	0
Double everything	0
I would put the 9 on the bottom instead of the 5	0
One of you is going to do my job	0
So the vertical line test kind of just shows you visually if it hits more than one point that means its not a function	0
Nick thank you so much for sharing	0
Okay so now the width they got is down here and the height they got is up here	0
Do it with confidence	0
Perfect	0
If you did not do your homework that should be in your thing	0
Would you be willing to um write some of your summaries up on an overhead to share and I think Michelle wants an overhead sheet too	0
37 and 568 thousandths	0
You dont have to draw your boxes because your sheet already has boxes	0
Zero	0
Im going to throw in another one	0
Okay look at my list	0
Yes	0
I think that that ones false	0
Okay	0
I guarantee it	0
Watch what Adam does and if he does anything wrong	0
When we have the variable term in here A divided by B each term is raised to that power	0
This is no talking	0
OK the secret is that the first number in the triangle row if you put that in this place right before the equal sign it it ll work all the time so you just have to take the first the first number in the triangle row and put it before the equal sign	0
Yes	0
Be ready to explain	0
My reason for doing your math boxes first was I wanted to make sure I needed a space of where you were at so that I could make sure were doing what we need to be doing to get you ready	0
200 240 100 and 12	0
Now you can figure out what T one was	0
No I know your answers right but just so you know you read left to right	0
Thank you friend	0
Go ahead Write your answer down	0
There might be another number	0
So this one is going to give us two different ways to do this	0
Its going to look a little bit different	0
Voters in two neighborhoods were surveyed and asked would you vote yes for the construction of a new school gym	0
Okay	0
Okay so lets look first of all you didnt put your	0
And I added an extra line in there	0
Do you want it neater	0
Think about what we have learned as mathematicians	0
I was getting a little nervous there	0
I think we did that wrong	0
Go noodle	0
Im going to show you some addition expressions	0
Now as a team tell me how youre going to create that into a common denominator	0
Oh yes	0
Very good	0
Theres a whiteboard	0
So thats going down from left to right youve got your positive slope thats going up from left to right	0
Everyone else please be silent when Gabby explains her thinking	0
Yes	0
Uhoh	0
And then this is breaking it into wholes	0
Yeah no the number does	0
Get your answer ready	0
It says use the diagrams to complete each statement	0
Teacher Now I am making my bows half a meter in length	0
Good job	0
And then we can just kind of go the same order	0
Notice there are different kinds of secrets different people are making up but this kind of thing which is called a formula it s what mathematicians call a formula that formula let s you if I tell you the number in the box that let s you find what the number in the triangle is	0
One	0
If he has any leftover he eats those eggs breakfast	0
Like this could be like you spend 5 every two days 5 every two days or you spend 25 every day its those are the same thing	0
Okay very well	0
Thats negative four	0
Onethird pi r and say Well I took the square root of that	0
Yes	0
If you need some help I  might suggest taking them down to their unit fraction	0
If thats the level that youre at right now definitely do the easy ones the middle ones and the ones on the right the third column are more of the level that youre going to see on the quiz tomorrow	0
Have a seat	0
Okay	0
In the corner up here	0
On page one 186 there is a chart and you are supposed to write a number story to go with some number sentence cards I have the cards that you have to match up so you will have a picture or a representation	0
Yep	0
Put your lid on your marker	0
If you didnt hear what  said  said You know youre done when your number is smaller than six	0
When you are done you are going to write your measurements Ill wait	0
Set it up for how you think your area model should work	0
We need a facilitator at each group pick someone who is going to get the conversation started and see if you can share strategies	0
All right	0
No	0
12 times W Both times one is 12 plus five that gives you 17	0
Is five a factor of 12	0
So then whatever you do to the bottom	0
The easiest way to compare them if they have different denominators even if they do have the same numerator is to make them the same	0
I need some more paper though	0
Okay 11 Oh wait	0
So you could have done X16  70	0
Two Y minus one equals two	0
Yes	0
If you and your shoulder partner are finished raise your hand if youre finished	0
and say okay look I can go one more time	0
So get in there try your very hardest with it	0
So 138 and threeninths inches	0
Were going to use a piece of paper	0
Thank you Mr Zach	0
Oh wow I didnt do a very good job of writing that did I	0
So next code are sorry were not quite ready for the next code yet	0
Yeah	0
12 minus 20 is negative eight	0
I want to see a picture with labels	0
Im just doing this right now	0
the y intercept is always zero comma a number	0
So if I were to be doing this factor rainbow and double checking my work the next one I go check is two	0
Mmhmm	0
This is negative four zero	0
And one divided by one sixth equals six  because theres six one sixths in one	0
Okay there we go boys	0
I did it right	0
2x minus 2x is nothing	0
Okay	0
Right	0
Bruce you were not measured correctly	0
Thank you	0
Yes	0
I did both	0
You should be able to do this	0
I have but not much	0
Okay here we go	0
Well get your sniffers ready because were going to check to see how they smell	0
Itll be enough for both of us	0
Youre at a good point	0
So according to our directions for every one milliliter of blue paint we have three milliliters of yellow paint	0
So now approximately in the middle of the page look and we have some expressions	0
Heres the deal I was up way too late grading your quizzes	0
So I want to think	0
So thats where were going today is like theres a lot of pictures that are going to look like that with xs and ys as the definitions and then and where to go from there	0
Im going to give you 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1	0
No wrong	0
Were going to take like maybe 10 minutes	0
So lets make a proportion	0
Okay	0
Like this	0
2 x 120	0
Okay so those are all great answers	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
Right	0
All right the first question is I have a seven in the tens place and a five in the tenths place	0
I think its more than because 54 over a whole	0
Yes	0
Other	0
We talked about this middle one yesterday	0
You dont have to do anything in your notebook now	0
All right	0
You have to remember this carefully because this was a good exercise	0
Nine10ths six10ths	0
Thank you	0
So if we have to compromise five twelfths minus one tenth and Kira thought that the difference would be five tenths	0
I have a question	0
Baking	0
Okay so now I want to show just a couple other things	0
Okay	0
No	0
Okay	0
Well get there	0
Right there represents my 13	0
Okay sorry	0
X2 is negative two minus X1 which is zero	0
Thank you very  much Mark	0
I want you to talk to your partner about that and I want the person who didnt go first last time to go first this time	0
We just you understand	0
So like this angles 85 degrees and this angles 30 plus 55 which is 85 degrees	0
Listen very carefully	0
So why library to ice cream shop	0
That works too	0
Whatever the dependent variable is	0
Right now what were looking at this is what Queen Ann wants to keep for herself	0
Take off when you are at consensus	0
Good	0
Its important that a Mr Parker makes sure theyre asking the right question	0
What I would do is just pick something easy like that	0
Bom bom	0
Say yes for this	0
Extrapolate then to extend interpolate met to estimate but we have to figure out how they went gather	0
Hes really loud over there	0
Math Land is four to four	0
Did you see how you could put	0
Im okay with that	0
Thats the bottom though the 26	0
Excellent	0
Okay and then you are at the same table	0
Okay	0
Now we go back to the lesson	0
So now please answer these questions	0
There wouldnt have been any left	0
We are not learning new stuff right now were moving into new stuff very quickly	0
As long as it can still hear me thats all I care about	0
Okay	0
So theyll go pretty quick	0
Okay look look look at the fivesided polygon we call it pentagon	0
If you think Im only 20 then	0
Okay	0
You guys are going to be talking about area of something	0
When you click on the first link if you dont have a Khan Academy account youve got to click on sign up at the top	0
Okay well lets go back	0
Lets check with  him if he interprets the way	0
So A is this point and this point is four comma Nope	0
Slope Yintercept	0
Right	0
Remember our learning goal today is what does this information mean	0
Two different ways	0
Good job	0
My next group of 34 is going to include the last 14 between zero and one and then 14 between one and two and then a second 14	0
Step 1	0
Very good	0
So anytime I can build that into our management system its reEy powerful for their learning and their growth as a scholar	0
says 19	0
And you could put other names for one here	0
No	0
OK it only depends on the number in the box if I tell you the number in the box then you can find the number in the triangle	0
the two articles for the worlds poor drinking water can kill by oh well we dont need a by	0
Because youre five pulled	0
Im going to tell you I want to transition the in the class in just a moment but I hope you were able to see how changing specific values of the coordinates changes the way that the shape looks or the object looks	0
Okay thank you	0
You have five seconds	0
First the Ss in group A serve themselves some of the casserole then the Ss in group B took some of what was left	0
So now we can fill in the pieces	0
Thats why I have the computers down	0
Start walking on your treadmill	0
This one and this one as your top	0
Im very sad that your cameras are off right now	0
It should be 5 over here	0
So please title your notes	0
Very well	0
Correct	0
So what were doing is were taking a complex problem that we cant do in our head easily	0
Somebody come up here and place the purple dot and a spot that has the same cosine as the green dot	0
the board	0
So every time you go over three you go up to so you have all these even numbers here 246 810	0
What would it say the problem	0
Just figure out where the next nice point is on the graph	0
In fact I would like you  to write me a little explanation of why you think it s three  or four or whatever you think it is and how you could  convince somebody of your answers	0
Im a little errorhappy today apparently	0
Sit on the carpet	0
I want to check in with if you got it	0
You need to have enough number sense to know if Im subtracting its going to be lower	0
Thank you	0
Lydia continue	0
Greatest means biggest	0
Some of our	0
Okay	0
So its really hard to divide fifths	0
Okay	0
So	0
Yes Brandon	0
Let me give you ten seconds think time	0
And then	0
So I want everyone now on their own piece of paper I repeat on your own piece of paper	0
Keep going	0
Open your math journals to page 176	0
You guys already did this	0
Lets see how easy it is	0
Okay Miss Felix	0
I personally have tried surfing like a couple times and I am really not good at it	0
Spend about five minutes describing what you think what its going to look like	0
Get your math journal go to 134 and find out what	0
Uh	0
okay	0
Now after you put your first and your last name on it I want to show you one more thing about my expectations	0
Thirty	0
Okay because a line goes on forever	0
What	0
What I know is that Im trying to get up to 172	0
There you go	0
All right but still dont spend too much time doing it	0
I wanted us to solve those ones	0
X2 Y2 thats our second point	0
Okay and in   the bag I pick is either twenty five red and five blue twenty red or ten blue ten red or twenty blue but I don t know which bag is which	0
On the first one	0
You can copy me but thats only one possible way to get to the answer theres a plethora of others and theres actually a much better way if you do 5 x 40 its a much better faster way	0
Okay and yes Hunter they do make a cool pattern	0
Partner or me	0
Keep going	0
Its 180 degrees and this is 90 you can come up with this checkpoint here that says the relationship between the inscribed angle and the intercepted arc is the fact that its half of what that arc is	0
I dont know	0
Okay now when you write this youre like you might be saying yourself okay well zero x is kind of ridiculous to write in an equation that doesnt tell us anything	0
Okay Im gonna break you off into 10 rooms but Im going to adjust some rooms	0
Thats correct thank you	0
Okay Alright so like I said were gonna kind of alternate between online and in here	0
Here are some more of them	0
If you cant do this or if you dont have like steps you can take	0
Im gonna ask that we go ahead and flip to the next table which will be on blue paper	0
Mmhmm	0
Oh Kurt is down with	0
You didnt actually give us the whole	0
So youre going to read it together each one of you in your group	0
For this shape couple things you might notice are this distance and this distance are the same	0
So we would know that a mixed number renamed as an improper fraction the mixed number and the improper fraction are equivalent	0
Alright	0
So double the first coordinate of all the points	0
Weve talked about equivalent fractions so much	0
Take them one at a time	0
Okay wait a minute	0
Im going to show you a rubric	0
Because this side is attached to a right angle so you call that a rightangled side	0
Now I want you to think about that a little bit and thats my  statement	0
That would be red line divided by green line	0
Okay	0
I know this is a difficult job	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
Put that	0
25	0
Im technically multiplying by one	0
What if you just do M  W x 10	0
Now the  question is Jim has one fewer tennis balls than Don	0
Okay	0
So Karennoticed one two three four five six	0
Now were going to go up to clue number one	0
Lovely Mr Camden	0
Okay	0
Really great mathematical thinking	0
Now were taking fractions and connecting them to division	0
The problems are up there	0
224 135	0
Okay so PTN is 80	0
Whatever were doing on the top here with these numbers are going to stay on the top and were going to multiply and divide with those	0
One hundredth	0
Who does not have partners	0
To the thousandths	0
So I wrote out twelve and eightyfour hundredths	0
Oh sorry showdown	0
This is one fourth	0
Yeah so this one says it needs twothirds meters to make  one	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
I mean we revise things over and over	0
This guy is a pyramid its on its one base right here	0
I just used long division because I have paper	0
Either way I want I want them to teach it to you	0
Theres this shape this is a net	0
This is how I did it Paul	0
Were going to be working on words like perpendicular coordinate grid	0
Mr Parker call it a thinking bubble same thing	0
That is correct	0
Or something like	0
Okay then	0
So that means this equals this this equals this	0
If you answered my questions the last time I owe you Eagle bucks	0
Sweet	0
This would be like  I have no idea what youre talking about	0
The thing left with 1000	0
Okay	0
Guys	0
Some of you guys were distracting me	0
Okay hang on just a sec	0
What we  have a linear factor and a linear factor	0
All right Ill go through the instructions with you	0
Well thats great because Im about to give you an assessment on this	0
Im like Youre kidding me right	0
If you wanted to use the workup here youve already done one fifth	0
10 and 14	0
So this is a parallelogram	0
So it would be 4 and 0 0 and 3 0 and 15 2 and 15 4 and 12 0 and 15 4 and	0
So we have three different ways to explain that	0
Maybe its possible	0
So when you think about this answer explain how you know your answer is reasonable	0
So lets write that up here	0
So double arrows for those	0
Okay can you guys just take a minute and copy this chart down on the paper in front of you	0
I want you to use your time really well	0
Okay so Thursday posted that earlier today you have the blank slides that were gonna be talking about today	0
A whole number and a fraction	0
There we go	0
Lets multiply by three	0
He is worried that he is almost out	0
Where two factions are being multiplied	0
The equation is five by eight	0
Here is the next one	0
And the next one is 49	0
Okay	0
If 8 x 6 is 48 you have to add on this 4	0
In order to do that it looks like some of you need to clear off your desk	0
So Im going to read it again	0
Okay	0
Lets rewatch the videos	0
Okay	0
Okay this first page were going to go through pretty quickly especially the first two parts and then were going to slow down on diagonals at the bottom	0
I heard some people  say that where they thought about it like two  quarters being like fifty cents	0
Everyone	0
All 10 of these are either going to have the same numerator or the same denominator	0
Lets ask our question	0
One times five	0
I want you to	0
And if its higher than any prior unit score Ill replace that lowest with the final exam	0
Shh	0
Everyone write it down	0
But thats actually not what the answer is	0
See if you can try an estimate and then well talk about how to do that some of you know how to round and we will work on that	0
Cool	0
Here I only get one slice here I get seven	0
Zero zero zero four	0
Guys if you can t see it s ok if you scoot your chair	0
There is Bandos land	0
We are going to make something today called tuna noodle casserole	0
So not the same amount	0
Okay	0
I heard some of you say two	0
And see what you come up if you work on that	0
You ve got to hold the mike	0
I say oh sorry	0
18 closes it	0
First check your tick marks	0
I want you draw a picture after Raymar ate 14 of a pan of brownies	0
Hes going to start talking but I want you to be able to explain if he cannot	0
Okay	0
Because adding fractions I need you to use your cards I think	0
3 for X 1 for Y	0
No	0
Its on the top of page eight if you want to read it	0
Yes	0
Hi how are you	0
I want you to create a ratio table under question number two in your packet please	0
However please choose a sequence for yourself	0
We are trying to find the slope of the line that goes through these two points	0
Four fraction 12 times 100	0
Two	0
Im so sorry	0
Okay you have to ask your  partner	0
Okay	0
All right	0
Your choices are you may be a part of the table group or you may be alone or over here	0
Good job using your resources	0
All right so	0
Okay	0
Yeah I do cuz you have twenty	0
If you 101 if you need help with this	0
According to me its approximately 42 people got a 20 to 30 percent score	0
Math journal	0
And then we would have three fifths and three fifths is the smallest	0
You may now start playing for a few minutes	0
Teresa always write approximate number	0
Then I need to understand greater than	0
Im going to clean this one	0
Miles per hour is if youre going 40 miles per hour	0
and were going to look at what you need to know in order to solve these problems	0
Oh I think Aiden already did that	0
Like that thats pretending he was a member of breaking out process	0
Sit down	0
Being able to take apart and redo	0
Good job	0
Okay	0
Three divided by one is three and four divided by one is four	0
I wont tell you again	0
Lots of ways that we can tackle this problem	0
Okay you say as long I whatever I do I do it in the same candy bar  that s fair but what I can t start doing is switching	0
Hes so close	0
Hold on	0
Can you see	0
100 times two is 200 100 times five is 500	0
You have three options	0
And were gonna take a quick break	0
So crew Im going to write  OJ for orange juice and SW for soda water	0
Yes it is closest to 1 because 45 is close to 1 and then we are adding 14 to that so its very close to 1	0
Bravo	0
This time please buy 20 apples and oranges altogether	0
But since youre dividing which is the opposite of multiplying you just do it times 2 basically and then you minus the zero	0
I agree	0
16	0
Hurry	0
Right	0
Im still confused	0
And if we look at number six two times four is eight	0
Okay one of those white blocks	0
I think that the total you get it adds by two	0
But yes Joey it always works to do the quick common denominator but I want you to understand that there is another method	0
Youre making a prediction because you have no way of knowing right now whos going to win	0
Good	0
Okay	0
So A is equal to the square root of nine	0
I could do 6 x 10	0
And then lets see if we can write out a triangle here	0
Excellent job catching your mistake	0
Or can we use seven eight and To make 56 because seven times eight	0
Okay	0
That makes me so happy	0
Okay my friends I want to hear your thinking I want to see on your whiteboard how much you shaded in blue how much is shaded in red and how much is shaded in all on both partners whiteboards	0
So we need to figure out based on these those other ones what they are	0
It could be	0
So our Y value is one half	0
Im so impressed with how youre catching on to our decimals just on less than 12 when everyones had all the lessons before	0
140	0
Im going to give you guys 90 seconds to do question number two	0
Ok thats very good	0
I just needed clarification	0
Can I take my paper	0
All right	0
Yeah	0
pick me	0
Lets go I should here solid conversation and I should see you guys working	0
You see three goes into six two times and if you set it up like this three times two plus zero you get six and that s that number I didn t put the triangle in	0
Okay	0
I was supposed to say false	0
Hundredths place	0
Just think about how this is going to be constructed and read what it says there	0
Im wondering which is bigger one half or two thirds	0
You need to be ready next time unless you are ready	0
Shes got three boxes here	0
I know that I can divide this up into 120 and 21	0
Friends I just want you to pause for a second and turn your chairs towards the SMART Board	0
I get to bite from here then I get to bite from here and then I get to bite from here and then I get to bite from here	0
Ms Koski	0
We might be asked to find the quotient which should trigger us to think Oh my gosh now we need to divide	0
We can look at it	0
And then you d be going down after	0
Im so glad you said that	0
The next one I have two trickier denominators	0
Eyes on me	0
Okay	0
We can double it right and 2 yerts would be 123456	0
So this is this line is pretty flat its not very steep	0
Okay	0
And thats pretty much going to be it for today	0
So lets try example C the third one	0
Okay	0
You just missing one letter	0
For 56 hopefully you know one factor pair	0
Line	0
Yes	0
If you can figure that out you have the answer to this problem	0
Pieces in the middle	0
Area model	0
So were going to add in one piece of information over here for number three	0
No	0
Okay	0
So just start those	0
Before we can really get into multiplication wrestling	0
So 110 times seven is 770	0
Thats part of the evidence we need	0
So this is what your table should look like	0
This one is a kind of a joke but is also Vick not really a joke and its got mix results today but I think its pretty funny	0
Okay	0
Do this on the back	0
These problems are already written down for you so have some really nice neat accurate examples to look at when youre studying	0
Thats the first mistake you did	0
And then for	0
Lets go	0
Okay we got it backwards	0
Thats great	0
You could do it more exact on the board	0
420 of a square meter is what you need to cover that carpet	0
For today depending on who your partner yourself up with I am going to allow you to work with whoever you would want	0
Twelve meters of ribbon one third meter each	0
Mm hm	0
You guys you need to stay with me	0
Good job	0
Then 60 yen	0
That one is more problematic	0
We are going to learn one more little thing	0
You need to figure out why you didnt get 102	0
We need two things in our equation	0
Give me an example of why do you use area and how do you use multiplication when were talking about an area problem	0
Color it in	0
I would like you to even work with a partner if you want	0
Just use like just use like a big dot on Pear Deck if youd like	0
Theres one slope	0
All right good job	0
You would have to count this and this but knowing in your head that this is going to be zero because I cant start with onesixth here because that doesnt make sense	0
How can you show Franc that you are showing him respect	0
Number two make sure you put in your best effort in class every day	0
I finished there	0
You can use the markers if you want just be careful	0
Now youre here	0
So now youve done with your pencil so you did 16two	0
I want her to be with you please	0
These are both numbers	0
Cuz if it doesnt let me know	0
Several of you alright	0
We cant multiply by a literal part Were not allowed to do that	0
Heres another one that I dont know if any of you thought of	0
Okay so Ill show you some answers for this one	0
Hopefully you agree this side equals this side	0
Theres 20 in the journal but plenty of problems in the journal	0
You are such a smart lady but I dont believe you	0
There were several people who didnt have problem 23	0
This one said 6 13 but it should be 9 13	0
8X3	0
Okay work on those next problems with your partner	0
Its got slope y intercept equations tables graphs thats our main topics in chapter four	0
Good	0
You can just tell me	0
If youre thinking same cosine	0
Right	0
I have a few folks that just stepped out for a minute	0
Awesome	0
Gonna be a rough weekend now until all the way until next Tuesday when I can have a chance to redeem myself	0
A squared equal to nine because it is given that the square of A is nine	0
Haha	0
Mmhmm	0
The biggest thing from this homework was that you feel comfortable using an order value bar chart and the biggest thing for today is that I really want us to start to figure out like how do we if we just have a data set how do we find all of these things and feel comfortable using graphs like this lists and the line of thoughts	0
Oh sorry	0
Well were not on 162	0
So to even out the heights	0
Thats just whatOkay because you understand	0
Basically the best I can tell you is thats the way our Mr Parkers taught me when I was a kid its the lazy way	0
Now were not talking about clothes but like model a problem	0
In this machine I put a three and I get a zero	0
All right lets move on to the equation	0
Okay awesome	0
If you want to find the intercepts that basically means do the table trick	0
I cant add them together	0
And right away like if you have this equation you can fill in slope and y intercept right away once you know the equation	0
So just to do this Im going to show you	0
Theyre over here	0
When youre talking about multiples youre talking about those numbers that we would use when we were skip counting	0
Close to one	0
Well check it will it mark it right if you write it like that	0
Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others	0
You can do it	0
Okay pass it out	0
Oh my gosh	0
Thats fine	0
this is going to be a work in progress that were all going to continue to add to	0
And then since this line is steeper this person said they jogged up the hill took another break for about two minutes ran down the hill maybe took a break here and then slowly walked down the rest	0
Right right exactly	0
No	0
Try plugging in a different number like say 3x15 or something like that	0
Yeah	0
No	0
So same as that were looking at here	0
And Ill be sending out info about that	0
34 of the roses are red	0
No I just want one for each	0
Dont take them in	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
They also claim that there are infinitely many fractions	0
But youre too smart not to be challenged	0
I did five	0
No Clay	0
Four	0
Equals is equal to	0
These are not equivalent because this is one slice this is three slices	0
So in case you forgot congruent means equal or the same	0
So this is a 90 degree angle right here which means all of them around there are 90 degree angles	0
Let me see if I covered everything	0
So we have park entrance pizzeria ice cream shop	0
In your note catcher today is an example	0
Okay	0
Fill in the data table based on a given rule	0
Im sorry	0
We might think differently	0
And lets see it may be addition it may be subtraction	0
Group three two you have a lot of random side conversations going on	0
All right see you later	0
So I would like you to go ahead and solve that and try using I want you to come up with an estimate and a number model and you can try to solve it and then well talk about it	0
Okay so let s	0
Okay	0
But before we get there Im gonna go through the three different rules of multiplying exponents	0
Right	0
They agree with your second solution but not your  first	0
Ill tell you when you get there	0
Everyone put your markers down put your hands in your lap show Margo active listening	0
You dont have them on here	0
You re multiplying	0
Its awfully quiet	0
Write a number model for the number story then make an estimate do not solve the story	0
And also	0
One two three you guys dont have a four	0
All right so Im going to stop talking now unless there are questions	0
I hear you saying some good things Tamba	0
Mhm yes yes	0
Expanded form	0
For this there are t two more more	0
He ordered six packages	0
We move two people from Pablo and then two of Ollies house	0
colinear co planar segment Ray length of a segment and current segments	0
Absolutely	0
Were using our math vocabulary	0
Theres three questions that look something like this	0
You are listening to strategies	0
Hold in	0
Okay so heres what you need to remember when youre doing it	0
Good	0
You are going to turn to journal page 146	0
So  they re different like that	0
That was one of the problems	0
Okay	0
So lets go back to perimeter	0
It is located on the upper side	0
Good	0
Noelle had onethird liter of water	0
Here you can rewrite it	0
I have some of this up here	0
Lets rewrite it	0
Because that would say each orange  multiplied and turned into five oranges	0
So now here is what I need you to do	0
I can abbreviate ounces as oz but I am going to put 10 ounces because these are different measurements	0
Next problem	0
Then if you subtract your Ys its one minus one which is zero	0
Let me make a  friendly suggestion to you	0
Some of you are  already working on different problems by now now we  have Andrew back he can tell us his theory so I thought  you know maybe we would start with that and then you  know try to have you all contribute and share and wouldnt  it be nice to know what other people are doing now	0
Then since you only have 2100 yen with you youll be in trouble if it isnt less than this	0
So this is your new problem	0
So we started with five	0
I have to borrow from next door	0
Well we ask ourselves Can we make any more bags	0
This would be 35 still going down by five	0
You have to think about that	0
The four is from point B	0
Four Pi R cubed over three	0
She did it perfectly but youre not paying attention to your own classmates	0
So its kind of like a triangle with a dent in it	0
So what Im going to do this right here is column one	0
Oh gosh	0
We re talking  about either cakes that are exactly the same size or candy  bars that are exactly the same size	0
It says simplest form	0
Give me five real fast	0
You can find the area when the perimeter and only one side length are known	0

Show me those steps	0
Oh my goodness	0
Okay	0
Let me see	0
And then if we make some mistakes we can easily go back and see what we did	0
You know that the area  equals 30 inches squared	0
Take a guess anyway because it doesnt matter if youre wrong	0
Then we could relate it to how we really use graphing in the real world	0
Yes	0
Please only complete math boxes one three four and five	0
Julia has requested that we wait one more minute	0
Thank you	0
Lets go to this one	0

Perfect	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Six people are trying to share one pizza	0
Did it work	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
I said that you could figure out what kind of math itd be  addition	0
Ahh	0
Uh I am under the impression that not everyone is working	0
Excellent idea	0
I see that you built a model that has two oranges  and a purple that youre calling one	0
Okay	0
34 of the roses are red	0
But youll see that its kind of fun	0
Ill read it for her	0
You have to go to the dashboard	0
Sketch five and 12 for me	0
So if that doesnt work then you should try putting parentheses around the addition and subtraction	0
If you could take 21 fifths and multiply it by	0
This confuses me	0
Or undefined slope	0
I was grabbing a notebook	0
Youre not starting at negative 10 here	0
Everybody put their dots in the right place	0
Okay	0
So lets make it a really productive day	0
Look at the thirds	0
You cant eat the Smarties	0
Okay imagine were back to the beginning we only have the two points	0
Were going to move on to subtraction	0
Okay	0
So like the trapezoid one is tricky to remember the rhombus and the kites might be tricky cause we havent worked on that very long but writing it down helps you out memorizing it	0
Four three two one and zero	0
Thats what you just said	0
Multiplication	0
US traditional	0
He made an observation about powers of 10	0
But I dont want it to be so small that I cant write in it	0
This will lead you to the problem the answer of these and you have to  lots of that lots of these  Then if youre  the two the first  would be C	0
Four minus two is two	0
It cant be zero point	0
A says Write a fraction that are equivalent to one	0
Let me see what you did	0
Okay	0
Okay so a x and Q	0
Yeah I think so	0
Sixninths or six10ths	0
Im kind of wondering what you are thinking	0

It looks like shes divided this up into highlighters and lead and pencil and pen	0
You could draw anything	0
I would like you to write in your math journals or in your Not your math journals This	0
Adjacent means next to each other	0
look at the number of minus three	0
Okay	0
Mines eight point five	0
Which is I can use a tape diagram to represent equal sized groups and divide the number of groups	0
Well here we dont have a complete sentence	0
Very good	0
So you cut them out and give them is it yours Natalie	0
You guys listen up	0
This is a little bit tricky	0
I want you to simplify that	0
For the firebird reptilia	0
Mine works	0
Thats awesome	0

S double prime	0
Okay pencils down	0
Were going to go back and look at yesterdays success criteria	0
Okay so rectangle has that extra piece diagonals congruent	0
It s the size  of the red	0
Thats what weve been talking about yesterday	0
Okay	0
Im not sure	0
Go on cut it and also if you fail you can do it again	0
I have a question on like number three	0
Exactly	0
Four	0
Okay	0
So when we are working on measuring something if it is closest to a fourth it is easier to do it doing 3 3 12 4 4 12 5 5 12 6 6 12	0
Great job	0
Clearly you must come up with a title  that conveys what information youre trying to pass on	0
What I have is a predicate running home	0
You went and sat over there	0
Yeah	0
Yes	0
sanitize my hands when youre gonna get hand sanitizer all over it	0
Good work	0
Right	0
I wanted you to demonstrate later how you do those types of exercises	0
I saw 21	0
Oh the diagram was too small	0
We are going to get started in a minute and we will share  some of these	0
Yeah	0
I said yes it was greater because whenever youre timesing the number thats bigger than one the number always gets bigger and so then whatever 45 times 9 always got bigger than the answer	0
Ok	0
Oh I erase that and sure enough	0
wants to put a picture of a larger book on his folder	0
I know what you did	0
Mute your microphones	0
You may erase	0
Now	0
Well maybe well see if it works	0
Divide	0
All right	0
So you need to answer the question first	0
Oh I was gonna write X over two	0
Yes but you dont have to write the plus down	0
S times S	0
Hit the dots hog up against the asymptotes	0
Give me five	0
I think you got it	0
So youre going to have to in some way figure it out or you must use the formula which weve discovered	0
Good	0
Lets see what my average score was	0
So these angles same theyre the same so theyre congruent	0
Another example	0
So lets start over as if we didnt even do this	0
We have got your vote for Cassidy in	0
Okay	0
It starts right here	0
Height is X I is zero comma X	0
Were missing one slice out of the pizza but its a pretty big slice	0
Yes	0

Did you guys bring your homework SSright how did	0
Hey	0
That s okay	0
If my coordinate is three and two and a half thats where it would be	0
where the worksheet is that were working on today	0
Mr Charles your hands should be off material	0
That means all the drawn parts here are included	0
Im going to ask someone to respond to Nadias thinking with my thinking was similar my thinking was different or Id like to add	0
Why dont you fill in for uh uh	0
We want to know how many since 34 roses are red so	0

I got it right	0
Theyre just looking for it without the decimal	0
Theres my pointer	0
Im going to put my Zachet on because Im just a little chilly	0
Thank you	0
Only one of those will match diagram D All right crew	0
I would like you meeting with a partner verify your answers and then you and that partner are going to work together	0

you didnt finish out here	0
There vertical line	0
Okay	0
Oh Erik thinks he has an argument to  convince me theres not a smaller one because Jessica doesnt  believe it	0
Theyre not quite even	0
He is correct in his thinking so please listen to what he is saying so that you understand what youre doing	0
I was kind of thinking we were going to have one tomorrow	0
And thats you multiply	0

There are no thousandths Im going to put a zero there	0
The ratio of orange to purple dinosaurs is two to four	0
And youre gonna see this this picture a lot today as well	0
So in the A example the answer was equal	0
Ends in a Y	0
Youre welcome	0
Okay Robs question actually brought up another thought in my head	0
I should see SSs finishing and bringing me their rubric and their paper	0
So you have to find 40 of 10	0
You got it my friend	0
That is a line of learning that you could say	0
When I subtract it leaves me with 3	0
Some of these are hard	0
Two	0
I believe its going to give me one more sample	0
All right weve got one more to go everybody	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
Im still writing it	0
Its a hard word	0
Maybe Mrs Phillips can let you combine and  build together that might take a little while and a camera	0
Then this isnt up there but I want you to then pass the card around so everybody can look at it	0
Good	0
234 or five is because youre really just thinking of like if you were to highlight where you have the x values we have a dot at two we have a dot at three we have a dot at four we have a dot five so its just happens that five happens twice but youre not going to repeat it	0
So guys you need to make those corrections	0
My friends that Ive checked in with you may continue working	0
You started at zero	0
Yeah	0
What	0
That is why I say even if the opponent gets the better numbers sometimes you can win because theyll make a mistake	0
6   12	0
Im looking for something that might happen with words	0
Look at this	0
It slides it	0
Put your name at the top	0
Thank you	0
Great job	0
Lets just look at three fifth and three fourths	0
Or the point five comma 11 is on the graph	0
Ill read it to you since Im not having you do it	0
Oh and lets talk really quick so time is the bottom and distance is yaxis	0
Please all have your mics on	0
Anyone else anyone else	0
You can just put it off to the side	0
Twice as fast means half the time	0
So you are going to think about everything that we have learned the last couple of days and put it all together	0
Okay	0
Should names be on our posters	0
I dont care if you dont have the picture	0
I love that Nathans got little rays helping him figure things out	0
Me	0
Yeah	0
So Im going to show you what fractions are going to be closer to zero whats going to be at a half	0
Elise I like that youre showing more than one way to write your ratios	0
Oh you need to display the answer	0
All right	0
So I will be working with you two guys more individually	0
Have you waited in line the whole time	0
Yes	0
Wait a minute	0
Okay	0
You can either relate it to division Let me see if I can borrow a marker	0
Just two holes to go	0
What I mean by all of your work	0
Okay	0
If you happen to finish this one and youre like Oh Im going to look at the example and see if I understand it	0
Also the additional subject matter	0
Yeah	0
Were going to divide each of these into five sections one two three four five so theyll each have five different sections here	0
Grayson I shouldnt hear any talking	0
I would suggest you to make both models in your  seats and keep them in front of you	0
Ah	0
That is what is double shaded	0
All right	0
Plus three	0
Were done with that one	0
Yeah	0
Okay	0
Okay so when we sampled again you saw more yellows than when we sampled the first time	0
Pairs compare	0
Oh yes	0
You could check your answer on the calculator	0
Not a linear function because its not a straight line then there would be no equation for this one	0
No	0
How do I	0
If I added 7 to get 12 then Im just going to write a 5 here because 5  7  12	0
I know Im pretty but the answers not on my forehead	0
Okay	0
We added 30 yerts and 4 yerts together to get 34	0
If your favorite number is three multiply by three	0
I have a two	0
Ow	0
Have the last three minutes started yet	0
Why dont you all sit  down	0
Yes	0
Every single homework assignment every single day every assignment youre getting those things done you dont have any missings in Infinite Campus	0
Stand up sit down fight fight fight	0
Rather than using that point you need to use the one thats already on there	0
Explain first of all greet your partner	0
Good	0
When it becomes a straight line then that will become a triangle	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Im not going to add it	0
We have one half	0
Good	0
Okay I see four people who did exactly what I asked	0
I have a rectangle again four centimeters by 10 centimeters	0
I didnt really understand	0
Have you guys got more problems	0
Im not going to put that under the success criteria but that is a good thought	0
I could count by fives I might run out of fingers	0
Let me give you	0
Okay it means 4 x 4	0
What are we doing	0
Steve	0
No he doesnt have the same answer	0
Because I think the y intercept just you just look at the graph or the table or the spot over here	0
If youre a person 21 in our line of 1000 people the first locker you touch is locker 21	0
Multiplication	0
Good	0
Now we will go ahead	0
Excellent job	0
Or for every one circle there are two squares	0
It will only fit one time	0
Why is it so hard though	0
X is 15 degrees	0
Your bases are actually here and here your bases are parallel to each other	0
Switch	0
64 hundredths minus three tenths 64 hundredths minus three tenths 64 hundredths minus three tenths	0
So the first one is 56	0
Good	0
That is too easy for you guys	0
Thats what you were saying a while ago Michael	0
Because I wrote an angle one here	0
Okay	0
So if you want to solve for y this is a 90 degree angle right here is how youre talking about	0
As a matter of fact this is a way an ideal way of labeling it	0
The order does matter	0
Hes gained some weight	0
Im not sure	0
Let them think and then I will open it up to discussion	0
All right	0
my friend so Julia I was just sending dad an email because you are at a meeting	0
Lets see	0
Now I will summarize these into main points	0
I was doing 15 divided by five for the first rule	0
All right	0
Yeah	0
So I want us to think about whats happening here	0
Now suppose you had a two game a a two game series but with these teams	0
Okay	0
So think about these	0
Youre gonna do three hes gonna do four	0
If you have papers you messed up on you can recycle them and then get out your math journal and give me a zero	0
I thought you see what I thought	0
All right eyes on me	0
So it is our goal to get a maroon paint value our total value up to 80	0
Yup	0
Let s start with 85	0
Yeah yeah yes yes yes	0
Yes	0
Um heres what were going to do now	0
Write them on your paper	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
Today thank you for taking care of all those things	0
32 for this one	0
Eric go back with Davis and Abbey	0
If you did that you will end up on a good path as well	0
Thats easy thats my phone	0
Thats what I need to know composing and breaking apart	0
Ive given you the easy way and you will have to think about how it relates to what you are doing	0
We cant do 34 34 yerts is not enough and I dont think people want to sleep outside	0
E  6	0
Thank you for your patience my loves	0
So if I did not	0
All right lets talk about this five three	0
Okay	0
You dont need to put the zero	0
We cut it in half or we doubled it	0
Thats very intricate	0
So you got the right answer but I dont know how	0
midpoint means its exactly in the middle of p and r So the symbol that were going to want to use is and Im going to write it just right here in the middle but were going to use this tick mark on both of them to show that these are equivalent	0
I didnt put my one under my under my two because it was 11	0
And then looking away and waiting for me to continue the lesson thats not a good mathematical conversation	0
One and one half	0
You do not	0
Check with the calculations if the measure you found is correct	0
Yees	0
They are ending up broken and I dont have any money to buy new ones	0
A B and C are collinear tells us nothing about if two things are equal to each other	0
We said that the emperors penguin would be shorter the chimpanzee would be taller and the kangaroo would be shorter	0
Your job is youre going to have about 5 minutes on your own and then Im going to put you in small groups to talk through share your thoughts and think about how you can actually divide	0
All right	0

We are trying to accomplish how many marbles fit in that bag	0
So horizontal	0
So color that half	0
All we got was attraction	0
I cant	0
You guys are going to know that this says times three	0
Make sure you are reviewing in the right way today	0
How do you fold two thirds	0
Okay	0
We are not getting graded on this one but that just means you should work as hard as you can because the next one yes will be graded	0
I am going to pass out your math journals and what I want  you to do is I want you to write out what you think you  learned for the past two days in math	0
Okay so we have a conjecture but we havent really got the evidence yet	0
Go ahead and take a standandstretch break for a minute	0
The out is so you bring the eight in	0
Because Ive got some misconceptions I can already tell you that	0
So we only have one square and fractions splitting up our square	0
The rules the functions and this is the table so thats why we call them function tables function machine function table	0
Good	0
Believe it or not	0
Thats right okay	0
Youre going to have to think about your knowledge	0
For example 21 fourths  equals five and a fourth	0
Okay	0
now I heard one pair discussing how processes were different	0
Yeah okay it is because the head is just my problem	0
Three well go into 21 seven times	0
Is	0
Tell us why	0
You dropped it right on the floor	0
Three dimensional is not flat	0
Now suppose this secret is right	0
But we really need to figure out what this 24 is actually telling us	0
True value is in the middle	0
Couldnt we just start by multiply six by 20	0
Which you would have to do on Monday	0
Lets keep that first set of fractions	0
Okay so try these out	0
And we knew that we should have a total	0
Last one	0
You missed an L	0
So today I can use US traditional multiplication to multiply two digit numbers by one digit numbers	0
If I really wanted to say okay what is this value of the zero is zero	0
Good	0
When you multiply by one the value stays the same	0
Yeah	0
This is impacting so mamny parts	0
So this is the time to buy over Presidents Day weekend there tend to be a lot of sales	0
So a function means that theres no repeats for the x values	0
You think closer to fiftyfifty	0
Everybody agree with that if you have three pieces to make a triangle with and theyre all the same you only can make the same triangle	0
B The A is going to be who has their birthday day closest to today	0
Were going to start with a variable expression and go to words	0
I am going to Nope were not gonna do that one	0
Right here dog is correct that we have 14 left over	0
Kathleen I dont see your thumb	0
You have about three minutes now on your own	0
Red	0
I guess what what Im confused about Jeff is you took this  one with blue and red and you only put a blue on the top	0
So please keep going	0
I didnt say put them back	0
Now sometimes and were going to talk about this today but sometimes youre not going to have a graph to work on this and you wont know your slope until you actually figure it out	0
When comparing the points of view of the authors of these two articles some commonalities can be found	0
Thanks	0
She was like oh wait no Ive got the right one	0
You do have a good start with your work keep going	0
So lets count five 10 15 20 25	0
Okay if you got them let me see what you get	0
So Im gonna say this Ill just flip your words around a little bit	0
Okay	0
All right	0
Yes maam	0
They are mixed numbers right now easier if I turned it into one	0
So we could go two minus one and one half	0
Were not doodling right now	0
I said we cant do the	0
Thank you darling	0
I need Theo I need Donte I need Maggie Aurora at the Anja I need you over at the table	0
So the reason you would want a three in the divisor is because then you would have to take away less	0
Equals 123	0
Try to get the location of the hidden treasure by entering coordinates	0
Let me try that again	0
Remember the arrows are the most important part	0
Its perfect	0
Can I come to dinner	0
Those were just examples to look at to find a pattern	0
Um then okay over here is the smaller brothers wallet	0
Now if  you magnified those spaces and here would be the little bars y you could divide this  space up into little tiny pieces and that you could divide up into little spaces	0
So dont do them again	0
This is one group of twothirds	0
That one also	0
Youre going to be selecting youre going to screenshot your username and your score in the same screenshot but youll see how that looks in a moment	0
Hey Jamie put that away	0
Not as pizza	0
Participate especially today were going to be doing a couple Pear Deck questions	0
And we all know when we evaluate or looking at our work to see what we did the same what we did different	0
We got different answers	0
look at the Y	0
Yeah	0
Your common denominator would be three	0
Cubed	0
Now he said from here add a blue	0
When we write the equation were going to say how many pouches we have how many points we have and what they equal	0
It doeSt matter	0
Yes a little nervous but just know that youre not the only one	0
Ill show you that in just a moment	0
All right the person whose birthday is coming next is going to answer first then be partner A	0
so the number has to be smaller	0
Yes	0
Count up by a whole	0
You were first	0
No Im not giving you any work to do on Wednesday	0
We come up with these crazy terms that dont mean anything	0
And 12 divided by three equals four	0
Should be linked in here	0
If I asked you to share please join me up front	0
Um Im seven seven and session returned to Google Slides	0
Because sometimes we	0
Another 30 seconds for you guys	0
Thats right	0
So what I would do is I would multiply my eight times my 12 Id get 96 on both sides of my equation	0
Okay	0
were only talking about the sides for this part	0
It can involve groceries	0
The same thing	0
Yup	0
Okay	0
Okay so heres another one	0
Were working on the warmup	0
Okay	0
Okay and then exactly in between four and seven is five and a half because you go up by one and a half up by one and a half	0
If you forgot how to solve it it is okay to look at the previous handout	0
Im gonna stop for a second Im gonna let you catch up with me	0
I think your picture will double in size because you are doubling both the X and Y coordinates to make it look bigger	0
I took the three pints of blueberries and i divided them into eighths	0
So today you will use place value strategies to compare decimals to 1000ths	0
Whenever I look at a table and its got coordinates the very first column is the very first number	0
So yeah finish those	0
I do need to see your work	0
Yeah	0
All right we are connecting fractions and division Part 1 EM for lesson 31	0
This right here is this	0
A few more minutes	0
My prediction was correct to make the book longer	0
Since twothirds is less than one whole we know that its going to go in more than one time	0
Eight	0
F is in between purple and yellow	0
Alright so down at the bottom we were talking about factors and factor pairs	0
And then if youve added a 10th to it	0
Patrick go work with Carl	0
But were getting good practice make sure that you ask questions	0
There you go so you would 20 here and then 30 may work	0
Oh all right	0
Thank you for working with me	0
We have threefifths plus onefifth is fourfifths	0
And then hes taking away four sixths	0
A half	0
I sent you an email this weekend	0
And	0
Nice	0
Yeah	0
Its like saying Well lets add a Landon plus an Anna	0
Wow	0
As a square you will only get that with a three	0
All right people	0
Think of the rectangle full of sheets of paper	0
So it is okay to think about this simply as coloring it in this way	0
Oh never mind	0
Awesome	0
And I think anytime you can embed any academic content in classroom management its reEy beneficial for students	0
But it shouldnt work	0
So we can rewrite this as one and 16	0
Okay zero	0
Okay so let me give you a problem to do	0
Right	0
Then hes got 030	0
You need two grids each of you	0
Okay	0
You can pick either Ashley or Nick	0
Okay let me make a change	0
Cause I erased it	0
never done it before and then its hard for me to know	0
Good	0
Okay	0
The first one needs to have in its rules where your ends met	0
the smaller brothers amount of money was greater than Ichiros	0
Okay	0
And then theres a third one where we can multiply by a number that is not equal to zero	0
So were moving onto 12 and the first oh no were right here	0
You only have three  spaces one two three you have one third from zero to one third two thirds  from one third to two thirds and three thirds area from two thirds to three thirds	0
Solving equations is gentlemen Ill keep waiting	0
Im going to see when we finish up and then Im going to give you the next step	0
Yes	0
Yessy Yessy	0
That it	0
10 because thats 30 and the 2	0
Okay very good	0
Now label the number line below to show whether two eights is closer to two or three	0
I was like Oh my gosh its 1130 I just wanted to look at their work so badly	0
You may	0
Ive got some in the middle	0
So I dont have answers here	0
Okay	0
Do we have to fill this out	0
Make sure you ask questions if you have questions	0
Thank you	0
So now that you guys are masters of ratio tables it makes it really easy to compare your quantities and to fill them up or to scale them down	0
Okay	0
So we are going to be dealing with fractions here which is lovely	0
Okay go to the very back page of your notes and lets actually do this one	0
I will know Im successful when my answer to numbers 2C on page 184 is clear specific and concise	0
Showdown	0
This is  something like five	0
So lets see what you come up with	0
Okay	0
Alright look at the numbers here	0
Its a straight angle	0
But you add 05 to go from five to 55 or thats the same thing as adding one half every time	0
All right	0
And thats what weve talked about we have talked a lot about the y intercept	0
Good	0
Okay so um it is now time for you to um take a quick little break	0
If you ve done it already you don t have to do it again unless you have some new ideas or if your thinking is extended	0
Now youre working at your group	0
Mika you did both pages	0
No were going to read it to start	0
Five four three two one zero	0
Now I want you to write the number sentence underneath it	0
And so just want to give you a way to think about it before I just let you go to start working on it	0
Make sure to put our decimal points in there	0
For now please finish copying the problems by 35 after the hour	0
Those are also equal in size	0
If he thought only 1 cup of cream goes into the whole recipe	0
Okay	0
Lets talk a little bit about equations	0
Record an equivalent mixed number or fraction with the same denominator on your slate	0
Yes	0
We talked about adjust	0
Multiplication rule	0
You used the proper names	0
You have about two minutes left friends two minutes	0
So lets get it	0
Im going to give you some think time	0
One way you can also think about these when you get an answer is you can be like okay 4  2  4  2  12	0
You used a pink piece put two yellow pieces on top of it added one more yellow	0
That it should be wider not taller and filled by 2 both the yaxis and xaxis which makes it zero	0
Much better	0
Is it	0
Way at the very top	0
If you dont have to make any changes then you can work independently on	0
We have to do the reading test	0
You can X out and then click again in the document	0
This is a picture of Washington DC	0
You know why this called an area model right	0
Its more like I want to see how big those brains are on top of your shoulders	0
Then your y intercept is the other thing you need to figure out	0
The person with the most pockets is going first	0
I did last year so I just	0
Okay	0
I am now going to publish 701 and You are to take that assessment	0
Oh yeah it does	0
Yeah thanks for let me know	0
You are playing spending safe	0
You really have to emphasize that	0
Crew you have a little space next to that first ratio table	0
Yes	0
Uhm	0
Unit fraction using the denominator of the fraction and find that fraction of a whole number then multiply the answer by the numerator thats what weve been doing	0
Its saying the opposite of X equals 2 and this ones saying if X equals 25 the opposite of X is 25	0
It definitely helps everybody out especially when some of the questions are a little bit tricky or youre a little stuck and then someone could just help you out	0
Looking that over before taking the quiz tomorrow or during the quiz as well	0
Y equals 3x plus two	0
Which is the same thing as one whole	0
How long is	0
In the equation Y equals MX plus B this is your slope	0
We have to	0
It might be worth it to rewrite the fraction so that you can focus just on the fractions and then decide which one is your correct answer	0
Sums	0
You got it	0
Thats what it wants you to do	0
Okay get your whiteboards out everybody	0
So lets check our work	0
What I would do	0
So thats all you need to know two triangles	0
So this means this is not a very steep line	0
Okay	0
Dont just simply remove it because then theres nothing there anymore	0
You need to make sure too	0
That way they can make sure that when theyre adding theyre adding the proper place value	0
You know what Brandon you did some incredible critical thinking right there	0
So again nothing was huge but it was sort of like a bowl of rice krispies a whole bunch of little things in there right	0
The rest of you could be making these if you havent already in  your seats just so you have them in front of you	0
The reason is I have to multiply it by both of the numbers on the other side	0
So now listen up	0
Then I said My prediction was correct because the picture was taller and wider	0
Right	0
Love it girl	0
So rather than me just teach straight up how to add which I will be doing also were going to try to see if we can do it by investigation	0
I dont know what theyre spending 5 on but theyre spending 5 every week	0
So you guys Im telling you the only answers Im going to accept are answers that refer to this	0
So I want you to write two sentences	0
A B Cubed	0
Due to our current situation students will not be allowed to go out during the break	0
Me	0
You know already	0
Could you please throw a window open	0
Kaylee welcome	0
What if I said I ate four of my eight cookies	0
Okay	0
Find next group of four so Im going to wait until those friends get moved where theyre going	0
Okay	0
Wow youre just raking in the box today girl because I randomly pulled your name out	0
So you can write it one of two ways	0
You guys still have 20 minutes left	0
These are the denominator	0
So one whole plus onefourth	0
Where is it the purple	0
Lets just keep rolling	0
When youre done put your colored pencil down and look at me	0
369	0
Yes	0
Ok thats true	0
Six seven eight nine 10 11	0
Hands on our desks	0
Okay	0
Five four three two one	0
You have time for the really hard one	0
You help your people	0
Another set could be constructed if you went the opposite direction with your rays	0
Right	0
Its like a Monday morning its like crickets in here	0
Who was sitting here	0
And when youre ready you can go ahead and share with your partner which one you think is correct	0
All right	0
Okay	0
Do not help them	0
Oh good I love it when that happens	0
Thirty point five seven	0
Ok that s move along then	0
Its not okay	0
Because yes	0
All right	0
Lets go ahead and get started	0
I need you to really listen to our conversation because I think it might help you with the open response problem that youre going to do	0
Okay lay your pencils down when youre done	0
It worked this time but what your brain is doing is its looking at all of the shapes and it is trying to determine which of these shapes do I need four of to make a complete circle	0
When were working through math problems we require the same amount of attention and focus	0
Okay	0
The ratio of eight to three	0
Okay	0
One	0
So Im not going to actually have you do those	0
I appreciate that	0
And then well take a break after that	0
It needs to be in four	0
So if youre not sure still give us an answer so we can think about what our answer could be	0
Ive been knowing that	0
Yours is five so sorry you might have a	0
This is driving me crazy	0
When we start to do partial products Im going to start to give you some graph paper which will help some of you to stay organized	0
Im just going to give this red a different number name	0
It is in my opinion the best strategy for giving change	0
Yes	0
Stay after class	0
One two three	0
Okay	0
waiting here	0
There you somehow have to make a decision you have to try it out	0
Whos ever journal have their writing in it please bring it up	0
Even though they were a different process that they were asking you to do hey we have that they come out the same	0
And it also doesnt make sense that T was born in a year 81 or in the year nine	0
Yeah it might be Erik when you were thinking more space you were thinking of extending  it	0
You have to be able to explain why it makes sense to you	0
X squared plus two times the product well 10 X plus 25 is the square of five	0
Now work out the problem	0
Okay so your slope should be two	0
Your objective today is I can determine which fraction operation to use and accurately solve the problem	0
Good job well said	0
So that means one times one	0
I would like to finish this first problem	0
You can put your hands down	0
My friends	0
Okay	0
12 is the same as 24	0
Person B raise your hand	0
Okay	0
So Im going to the gym tonight	0
Now he might he might not	0
Why dont you run over with Sydney Rebecca	0
Jyle you are not even trying	0
So lets do math	0
Or angle angle side or side angle side	0
Okay	0
Were not going to solve that one	0
I hardly played at all then I played into	0
Alright lets pull a stick and see if I can figure out what is the factor pairs for four	0
Oh that s interesting	0
Switch	0
Right	0
Sorry about that	0
Ten A equals 30	0
That one was a little harder	0
And then also for like tall and skinny or like one by four	0
Its four divided by five	0
This is number two	0
so were just gonna divide by two and Im gonna write it above y equals 90	0
Wallace are you here	0
So your number here wont be six	0
I need to distribute right here	0
I think you should	0
Because I think we had decided we werent going to do anymore which means I have to talk to my teammates because I think we need that	0
All right I just wanted to throw those words out there	0
I think that s a good idea	0
My friends at the table please turn off your little devices and one person bring them to me	0
I dont care	0
So one doesn t work	0
Okay	0
Just slightly different	0
In order to multiply something you have to jump over that wall every time	0
There we go	0
Youre doing an area model	0
Aiden and Caleb are going to do it on their own	0
Science	0
I mean youre going to really walk around all day in ski boots	0
Watch put your pencils down and watch because Im going to show you this once because were not ready for this yet I just want you to see it and be exposed to it	0
Not a marker	0
Now were going to do it the other way	0
Well later on Im going to have you present this part	0
Here we go buddy	0
All right	0
Uh huh yes	0
That wont quite work	0
No youre really having a conversation and coming up with Okay what do we feel like is the right answer	0
No	0
Think about it	0
Four legs	0
They are analyzing the data and then they relate it to other subjects all on their own	0
Yeah I think so on the second question well um both my models  were um like in this shape like that	0
Go ahead	0
Lets see what we can do on these	0
Okay what we have so far   here I ll write it in different colored chalk	0
Sir	0
Harrison	0
Im coming to my other friends in a minute	0
Im trying to create statistical database in this room	0
Okay come on over	0
I	0
And Estella calls and hes like Hey can I come to dinner too	0
Because all as it gives me here is how many of you actually responded in the categories that I needed you to respond in	0
Oh dear Lord Im sorry	0
Go back to your shared screen	0
At least that s how they re talking about decimals and fractions but we haven t spent a lot of time talking about percents	0
You can explain it	0
Well I dont know	0
Okay	0
Thats really going above and beyond	0
I already found it	0
Ready	0
You have some room down there	0
On the number one be prepared to share your argument for why you place the next where you did	0
So you can move it and it can match that group	0
So maybe what helps is to think about pieces of it	0
If you have an x1 up here youve got a pretty good hint about how the denominator is going to factor	0
Clay I need you to listen and pay attention	0
This one this one	0
Okay	0
Because this is what youre going to turn	0
Okay slope is undefined	0
Thats some of it	0
Then Im going to let you go ahead and do that	0
So thats seven and thats seven and this would be 13 in the middle there	0
Okay	0
All right	0
Each person is going to take a turn	0
We were not prepared for today	0
I want you to look at this answer	0
That works as well	0
Okay so your slope here is negative two	0
Laura thats not a third	0
So we have variable and variable expression	0
The line is going up like a ramp and then look at how he explained it by four	0
Nice job buddy	0
Good problem that is a good one to ask	0
Okay	0
Can this be for an example three plus one	0
Okay enter the last one	0
I love that we have people helping people out	0
We have the crab starfish	0
So the rise was six the rise was six between these points and all were doing is a shortcut here to do eight minus two you get six	0
No put them on the counter	0
Okay	0
It cant be 200 because five times four is 20	0
Now I have to figure out Oh nope sorry	0
Okay we know that the B is the y intercept	0
And you can sit and listen so that you have a better understanding	0
Blue blue and red	0
Write the whole equation but like for example equation one right here put a one next to it also	0
Heres where youre misunderstanding this	0
This is hard	0
Yeah exactly	0
You should write them down so youre ready to share	0
But its very logical answer	0
All of that was at the beginning of the unit we ended the unit with the hardest type of problem	0
When we put on our trapezoid	0
Also now I would like you to put your finger on the column with the original sailboats	0
Its a lot different with another auxiliary line	0
Yeah	0
So what I did was	0
The height of the new trapezoid is the same as the original trapezoid because Amys rule did not change the Ycoordinates	0
These are my multiples	0
So use this	0
Thats a vertical	0
Okay	0
We can do improper fractions	0
Talk through what you did	0
The reason thats important sometimes you might be asked to find the quotient of a problem	0
Thank you for bringing those over quickly quietly following directions right away chop chop chop	0
Awesome keep going	0
Okay so let me show you one more thing	0
Because when I put them all back together theyre the exact same size	0
It is time now	0
Okay	0
For number two	0
Youre supposed to stand up so I can get someone to have a proper conversation with you	0
Okay just got to think about it from left to right	0
Expand that out	0
You can absolutely write it like that but typicSSy were going to write Y equals or the second one equals	0
Youre going to have to get more creative	0
Actually for for the quiz for tomorrow	0
All right	0
You have to decide what is going to be the most efficient way to solve this problem	0
I want to leave this here	0
Okay so go ahead and draw a line if you can	0
Thank you for sharing your thinking	0
Friends were going to mingle around the room	0
Look at	0
Is it definitely recording	0
The rest of my friends	0
Now I need to show you how to write this vertically	0
Okay turn knee to knee	0
What	0
You dont	0
Equation one plus equation two	0
Yes	0
Thats our first angle plus x plus 10	0
Were not going to go there	0
Its unlikely that the ratio would be five to six	0
You can make up for it if you buy seven so this is three	0
Go ahead and see if you can find the starting number and the slope	0
M is the dependent one	0
It has a definitive starting point here	0
About two to three	0
You could even say that it equals five quadrapeds	0
When you are done you can work on page 142 and 143	0
Lots and lots of padding going on today	0
We need to start with the ones place	0
Then they labeled one side the other side is a variable	0
You shouldnt be recycling these papers you should be taking them home as a template tonight	0
To find out that that was 15	0
It does in the graph but not in the circle	0
Oh but you are sitting backwards	0
And in Flint Michigan and other places in the United States thats just causing health issues	0
So its just A over B	0
I want to see if some person understands the concept being used here	0
You have to master that	0
Yes you were supposed to write that	0
So it s just like this move that up there	0
Yes	0
This is 30 and then here you would write 20	0
Okay	0
Jahaira says if we do this when I look at it in terms of fractions that doesnt look great to me	0
Were going to make sure that you guys are getting the shapes of the whole right before we start trying to manipulate fractions by using addition	0
Now I worked with Jake and Eric so I know their answers	0
I think as teachers we really get you to count by ones by twos by fives and by tens	0
Write here and write here	0
You could either keep adding these up together or you could multiply whichever is easier for you whichever works better	0
Okay	0
I got common denominators there then I added those two things and now I have it into that form where I have a fraction equal to a fraction	0
Hold on a second because I dont know if we can think about it that way just from the word part	0
Im writing a thinking box over it you guys dont have to Im doing it so you understand that this needs to be here this is how you show your work in this	0
This is Dr Golden  who works also with us at Rutgers	0
So lets think about this	0
Okay	0
Whats great about fraction multiplication is you dont have to have a common denominator	0
Then youre choosing another one to do on that paper	0
Lets me know a little bit about your background	0
Okay	0
I love it	0
Yep	0
So everybody has to do one graph right	0
All right	0
If you need to go get one from counseling go get one from counseling	0
So well think about them a little next time too	0
Okay sit down	0
Something	0
It might be very similar to what you did but we all solve problems differently	0
I think this is so cool	0
Voice stop in three voice stop in two voice stop one and zero	0
Yeah wheres your	0
Youre not standing up and you cant be part of this when  right next to you	0
Yeah	0
Therefore 10 minus 10 it is zero	0
Yeah thats a common misconception	0
Ladies and gentlemen there are two things	0
When I put in three two times the three would be six	0
Psst Dan	0
Okay so if you could flip in your packet to page five thatd be great	0
15 answers	0
What if I was like Oh cool	0
There yes	0
Im going to be super on that today	0
And this says write a multiplication equation and a division equation from each of the following questions	0
I dont understand it	0
Natalie if you have me pinned you wont be able to see what Im presenting	0
Im sorry theyre not	0
You immediately walked up and the first words out of your mouth were	0
All right get to work	0
But for this one since its doesnt really work with the rules that weve been talking about were actually gonna write x equals and so this one is x equals negative four	0
Make the coordinates first	0
We really have to think about what we know about fractions	0
X stays exactly the same	0
Well think about it	0
A half cup of whole wheat flour	0
This is showing me why I love this reader so much	0
Awesome	0
One half plus one fourth	0
I physically had to find the common denominator	0
So this is kind of a weird case because its a vertical line	0
So now were looking at reading number stories	0
First factor	0
because if you look at it theres 6 tablespoons on the picture	0
Thats one	0
Okay	0
Youre going to have a whole bunch of moments where you feel like I get it	0
You need the warmup sheet and you need one of these	0
Shane just mentioned it before six X and one X then I get the six squared	0
Heres	0
It is a lot	0
Oh my gosh that sounds amazing	0
Oh poor Zach	0
You got up plot graph plotline sorry plotline that we can graph	0
Watch how I think of it	0
So then we can see that something a piece the size of one half will fit into eight one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 and 16	0
now I am going to stop sharing for just a moment	0
Wow interesting	0
And you can see for us Aiden	0
Because it takes two yellow rods to equal one  orange rod	0
And were going to add 12	0
Fifth graders use straight answer so do fourth graders who are in this class	0
So eight times five is 40	0
Did you find it in your notebooks	0
Its pretty close to those numbers	0
Yeah it was	0
Okay	0
You can easily check up by the vertices cause you should have angles A B C D E look in the middle	0
So we have the vertex	0
This is more straightforward than you think its going to be	0
So you re thinking more towards the impossible but you re not thinking totally impossible	0
For Zyon	0
Mmhmm	0
Okay Mr Strathom	0
We looked at one third we didnt look at one fourth but I think thats going to be okay	0
Okay	0
Just four X	0
Whiteboards	0
One of you whos confident	0
Of course thats being efficient	0
I will list them the two solutions	0
Because I know that that equals five	0
Most of the times theyre not cheating on purpose they just dont know their facts	0
If theres a group of four split into two groups of two please	0
After drawing the picture Jake decides he wants to put a picture of a larger book on his folder	0
I feel that that you dont have to	0
If I want to take my marker even if I were to line it up with the one half it doesnt line up with the three fifths	0
Subtract so my decimal equivalent is 125	0
Im sorry	0
And what I would say is this if you write to correct equations then youre then its going to work out probably and if its not working out then try to write take one of your equations and try to change it to something else	0
Now I would like you to put these papers away and take out your books	0
That would be 10 20 five	0
You are supposed to copy that thing right	0
Try to calculate the perimeter	0
Come on follow me	0
Youre multiplying	0
And I know a lot of you have used advisory time really well	0
All right	0
Okay thank you	0
Ok	0
Okay	0
Clear answers to the questions accurate work make revisions to our own work see class list of a good response	0
All together	0
No thats not	0
Okay	0
Oh Im not sure why that happened Blaze	0
Andrew disagrees	0
Lets take a moment	0
All right good	0
Show me what you have Adam	0
Heres what I would like the rest of you to do	0
First student to come up to the board is Paul	0
After how many seconds will all three lights flash at the same time for the first time	0
I didnt say it	0
Or one plus one plus one plus one plus one fifth is equal to four and one fifth	0
One can imagine it directly on the number line that way	0
All right if you are drawing on your whiteboard I will take it and you can use a piece of paper yes	0
If you had changed  this into a decimal and divided you get the same answer	0
Okay thank you very much	0
All right lets keep rocking and rolling	0
10 plus 3 is 13 and 1015 plus 615 is 1615	0
Thats the same thing as that vertical line hitting the graph twice	0
We know that 9 is 75	0
A restaurant serves you a 16fluidounce glass of juice that is 30 ice	0
So you could have done one half plus 13	0
Okay friends I would like you to move your desks back to their rows	0
Okay	0
It will take some time for you to get to that	0
Okay	0
So Im just going to leave them both there	0
And then Paul is going to sell eight more than Linda	0
I still got the same product as this number	0
Yes	0
I notice that the smaller ones are more than	0
Cool	0
Expectation is everyone will complete this	0
The username is up there	0
Ill get this thats fine	0
I have another problem I d like you to think about really quickly	0
My sticks are Maddy	0
Or if we had two people who were babysitters	0
He keeps on doing it	0
Have your eyes totally on the screen	0
point that divides a segment into two congruent parts	0
Yeah	0
And then maybe a couple of examples	0
You went yesterday so I think you can stay in today	0
Now you can chew the cud and think on the second tricky problem it is not much more difficult than the first one	0
The secant contains the center of the circle	0
That may be possible but	0
There were two people who were zero so this is zero	0
815	0
Okay	0
No	0
Thank you	0
Perfect	0
It is up to you whether or not you put your circles away but there are six problems for you to solve	0
So f of x changes into F of three	0
Okay	0
Look at me	0
Looking around I dont know if I saw everybody with 25 for median	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Were doing the 33 plus 54	0
Stand up push chairs in	0
Look	0
An X an X in the tens not a zero	0
Excellent	0
You dont always need to rush through things to get things done	0
Yeah	0
Yes	0
So that would be three and	0
No turn around and look	0
So its kind of the same as yesterday	0
So	0
Youre going to use it so much that it would be a point youll get it spelled right	0
So Im bringing it back	0
Im right here Auden is right here Mathias is right there	0
I actually dont have it on here	0
Excellent	0
No by a	0
Fine	0
Three whos person three	0
Today in our class well calculate and review work which we discussed in our previous class	0
And then we had Michael and  Giardo	0
Well yeah	0
x minus x those drop out of the equation	0
96 should be down here	0
I have extra and extra papers full bucket	0
Okay	0
I hate when I do that	0
So just take care of that one first	0
A fire drill	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
So Id like you to replace that in your formula and write down everything else	0
If youre not continue to work if you are well do number two together	0
3x3 is nine	0
okay	0
I dont want to know who your friends are knowing I need to know what you know	0
Right now we just want to know their heights up until theyre 20 months	0
Yeah	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Okay let me let s let s hear I  have heard two different answers I d like to hear both answers	0
This one	0
I dont care	0
Ten minus X	0
you could pin her	0
So Im going to ask you to stand this far away from the person you would like to work with	0
We call a series like that an arithmetical series	0
20 and seven	0
Youre good	0
Okay I can get you one of those	0
All right lets start that way	0
Thank you	0
Okay	0
We knew that the question as Landon said was a subtraction question because they wanted to know how much we had left	0
Yes	0
Okay and down here you have the answers so why dont you check your work	0
What I did for my estimate is I rounded 9480 thousands to 95 and	0
And we know there is one zero to give us our place holder okay	0
You could but think of all that wasted scale and how long that scale is gonna be on your pad so that you can then fit	0
Youre going to be exploring today	0
I get that X is equal to 48	0
And that is it for that	0
Okay	0
For a few hours the stems of each bunch need to sit in a mix of one cup of warm water and 38 teaspoon of food coloring	0
or like denominators and stuff	0
And then I know that one third is equal to four twelfths	0
Youve two days	0
Lets move this camera	0
Its an easy 10 multiplication	0
Yeah can we get it	0
Im going to stop you for a second	0
Please stop	0
576 eggs in a year	0
Now tell me how youre filling with this go	0
So guys	0
Any fraction you want between zero and two just tell us why you are doing it and you have to get the class to agree that that is a reasonable place	0
Thats still not a final answer	0
He draws a picture of a book on a coordinate grid	0
Yes theres a gap	0
Right	0
Maybe you can help me	0
Good predictions	0
And light green for fourths	0
20	0
What do you mean	0
Yeah	0
Ive seen a lot of people not restate the question	0
He packs as many full cartons as he can	0
Then you have to transpose it	0
I would always start out with three times nine which is 27	0
So if Im looking I know that if Im at 3619 I have one jump to get there	0
We have 12 and sum number of 36 plus 20 and sum number of 36	0
We love you guys but you dont count for this	0
All right we  do not have Oscar right now	0
Yes	0
So B double prime stays the same H goes to right here	0
Im going to give you one minute to do this because you should be able to do this in about a minute	0
Pi mmhmm	0
You need to write a rule that Jake can use to make the picture of the book larger	0
If you dilate a shape or you do a dilation on a shape you make it bigger or you make it smaller like Rory was saying	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
I know the base and have a height	0
Cell phone bill	0
So thats the whole thing from here to here	0
I will talk about another one that is simpler one that I have mentioned before	0
When youre looking at your multiplication chart if we were to go down any row or across we would see the multiples	0
We did Wednesday Friday and then Thursday we did 511	0
Leo wheres your journal	0
So if I wanted to continue my train with oranges youre saying I  would have trouble showing	0
Its going to tell me whats missing	0
Oh so she took that number and divided it by five for the first one	0
Five stays the same	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
Okay so when you guys are answering the question this is pretty straightforward	0
Like I was doing that before like 4 x 2 4 x 2	0
Spheres the same thing but it could be like forwards or back or down or upper or anywhere	0
Because this is a para these are all things that make a parallelogram	0
Lets do 38 48 and each time I do a row thats an eighth and then Im going to do 58	0
Ok go very slowly Kimberly	0
Yes	0
Could you please hey friends everybody listen when youre writing your multiplication remember that Ella and Zach referred to this as a coordinate grid	0
A line plot is one number line down below like we have over here	0
You said that was due Friday	0
You wrote them backwards	0
We already discussed this	0
Equal groups conversions area volume comparisons	0
This question asks you to draw a model	0
We do have two modes	0
Okay thank you	0
And then tomorrow obviously Ill post the Friday folder with the test in it	0
One more I want you to make an angle smaller than 90 degrees	0
Yes	0
Thats pretty good	0
I know man youre just right on	0
Alright lets do some more	0
We dont even know if that	0
Well we say its rise over run	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
People who say	0
Because then you get five	0
Does that mean	0
Yes	0
I knew that was 02 and red was 4710 and I added it and then for all of them I got 4910	0
Some things well do a little bit different	0
Okay keep going  come on up	0
Yeah	0
If youre going to  multiply the denominator by 3 then you have to multiply the numerator by 3	0
Theres nothing on this side but if Im counting by onesixth Im making that jump to onesixth	0
You are correct	0
You can answer that for me	0
Ten	0
This one sponsor B is linear sponsor A is proportional and linear and sponsor C is just linear	0
All right show me	0
Avery	0
Okay then lets start on page 121	0
But your magnifying factor will be the square root of that	0
Okay	0
So boys we made this up for you	0
Love it	0
Next	0
Okay so no worries	0
Thank you	0
To show your work how you got it	0
It doesnt matter who group of four	0
I know  so I should just double eight so the answer would be 16	0
Okay	0
Very good and that is smaller than or thats bigger than 12 hundredths	0
If you round then up to 12 then 1212 is 1 plus the other 1 is 2	0
All right	0
Okay	0
Sorry youre correct but you can read it for a few minutes while the other person finishes the computer	0
Well this was a few weeks ago but I was making Parmesan and if I followed the normal recipe it was going to be too much because we didnt need that much so I cut it in half	0
Okay	0
Just do your math	0
Talk to your table about it	0
And so they look like 90 degree angles but theyre just a little bit less	0
But twice or three times	0
Unfortunately you will not be able to see the incorrect answer	0
Anyday you need to	0
But youre exactly right	0
Well precisely Ill do it	0
Sixths	0
Mmhm	0
Balance is a word that we needed to think about or we need to talk about	0
This is 27 divided by three because you have a three on top instead of a one	0
So 180 is a perfectly straight line	0
Now I have 9093 minus 351	0
Exactly	0
So lets do a couple intercept questions kind of refresh our memory	0
Yes	0
Multiplication first	0
So the area of the big square is 1 square unit	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
That was the question	0
any group you want	0
Have a seat	0
First of all it doesnt have  and is it talking about do you love your dog or do you  the dog	0
Exactly	0
Red	0
Yeah	0
Now in your mind start thinking about what should be the percent	0
I appreciate it	0
I want to see all of your steps for number one	0
Okay	0
Oh	0
That one is the trickiest one Im going to tell you that	0
Okay	0
Youll notice them If you notice them then that will be great	0
But why just a three	0
Notice this number line	0
All right thank you for your math thinking	0
So this would be an example of an LCM problem	0
Did you say catdog	0
It can cross it	0
See what they  have to say	0
Lets see for each liter of orange juice lets see how much soda water there is	0
Well I can turn one half into an equivalent fraction that has a denominator of four	0
This was number two	0
Using any whole number 1 through 9 at most once	0
That means that about about 18 students are still looking for their answers	0
Thats very  interesting	0
Write down a linear equation in which you can calculate how much well	0
Someone decided to eat onesixth of that	0
I think we need some reminders	0
Are you back	0
If you look at the clock and you think Okay everybody make your clock	0
It is something	0
Okay	0
All right my loves were gonna go back to stop sharing	0
You can erase it	0
So if we go back into my screen share and I go to slide three	0
Lets play by the rules here guys	0
I want you to go back to playing high number toss with your friend and I do believe we have played this before	0
The board should be ready	0
We still want to make a whole	0
I dont know	0
is I know you know how to divide and	0
That means that Im going to be at 30 people so 5 yurts can accommodate 30 campers	0
Dont let it happen twice more	0
I understand though so Matt didn t lose me this time	0
Gosh so you changed your mind and  you said eight	0
This is so you guys can potentially write this explanation for me under constructive response part two	0
because the minus works for both expressions	0
What about inaudible	0
Now look next to it how they wrote it down	0
I want to put them into bags that hold six marbles each	0
This person Oh look at what they did	0
Thanks for asking	0
Those of you that are still working Clay its okay	0
What I d like you to try on the back while we re waiting	0
Think about what our learning objective was	0
Were going to see if it works both ways	0
Theres that last one	0
Erase that for me	0
Okay lets go to the next one	0
Thats all right	0
I havent changed it yet	0
Label the line	0
Try to follow the question and work out the sum of interior angles of a pentagon	0
Thank you	0
Okay I would like you to come up and may I see your answers	0
No its actually a journal a couple of journal problems	0
Because he says it would be doubled at X coordinate which	0
Kimberly I see youre using the British spelling of color	0
Be specific in your description	0
So this afternoon my friends Zach and Zoe I am going to forward you on email right this moment in time	0
You may	0
Round seven and fifteen hundredths to the nearest tenth	0
16 on each student	0
Private think time	0
Yes	0
So Ill write O equals Pi times two times R	0
Who taught you how to do that in your maths problem	0
So a table  I think tables are very underused	0
I couldnt follow	0
I see a couple of people finishing up coloring so Im going to give you about 10 seconds	0
Yes	0
You said 61	0
Mrs Strathom did her drawing wrong	0
You have learned this word before	0
If you make it too hard well itll be stressful	0
Two two	0
My older daughter whos a sophomore in college Caitlyn she goes to college way up here in Western Washington	0
Okay	0
Eight of you or so	0
So Parker your thinking that you explained	0
Because it needs to make 180 with the 60s	0
You put your homework where you think best makes sense	0
Yeah	0
And five times 10 is 50	0
Now I want all of you to see what Jessica and Andrew are  building and now you all cant come up at one time so Im gonna  if its ok with Mrs Phillips Im gonna ask you in little groups to go  up there and take a look at their model and um so we can be able to  talk about it and then some of you maybe can look at it from where  youre sitting	0
And so those things weve been working on every day all week so coordinate graphing quadrants quadrant 123 or four and then interpreting graphs slash stories	0
So Ive got x two which is 5 xtwo just five minus x one which is two	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
And if your camera doesnt go on I did not know youre with me	0
Were going to add that too	0
So you subtracted the whole numbers first	0
Not 12	0
That was a quick mental math thing I could do	0
Okay	0
No way	0
But that would be one third	0
For that cheese	0
All you have to do is to divide by 10	0
Hm	0
Friends if you did not know this this quick you do not know your multiplication facts and theres whats the problem is	0
Yes	0
Are you going to hand us out those half sheets	0
Please date your notes	0
Now here is the thing	0
The decimal is the first thing you write down	0
So this is your preimage	0
Thank you	0
That doesnt mean it can be greater but not of the top of our heads but it probably is a little greater because its multiplying it	0
Youll be 60 years old	0
Okay watch	0
This does not make sense in my head by the way	0
Looking at 25 and 14	0
Write down what you think is the correct answer and check it right away	0
I will see you tomorrow	0
This is again friends	0
Quadrant three	0
Going to write that in there	0
Zoe Im having a hard time understanding you	0
Okay theres a whole lot of vocabulary that you guys are going to need to know today and I will put it up here just to make sure that youve got it but lets start with the math message	0
Yes	0
Let s see what happens here	0
He knew he couldnt fit a half over here when he divided into thirds	0
If you would like to be my helper raise your hand	0
This is what youre going to see in your independent work later	0
Now add another three eighths to it	0
Hi doll babe	0
No I mean its thats just ridiculous	0
Is	0
it is also okay to use the outside with one bend or it is also okay to be outside with two bends	0
Now it wont be	0
Multiplication facts	0
I start out with a whole because I always start out with a whole	0
We can do 13 3 and then multiplied by 2 or we can do 132	0
Four 16ths	0
In order to eat half the pizza if its cut into four slices you have to eat two	0
All right	0
Thank you	0
Brandon you can find your seat sweetie	0
Ask a friend	0
This is the kind of question thats right up your alley	0
Just like on here the first number was represented by blue	0
Now I know what youre thinking	0
This will be the one that you solve mentally so you dont have to do that second stuff	0
Oh my goodness I have way too many magnets I think	0
Im going to read number two and then Im going to have both of you come around here	0
Oh thank you	0
I know for mine theyre never quite equal but I try	0
I cant see it	0
Theres no explanation	0
Youre changing one number and the rest becomes zeros	0
Your y intercept	0
Well we only have one answer so far	0
Physically manipulating something allows you to better understand	0
You need to do this again	0
Then by the way we draw the auxiliary lines in all we got three types	0
Right	0
Whats the card game	0
Heres my sentence well maybe I did two	0
Were going to show how much they go up by on both sides	0
Look at the agenda	0
Zero ten	0
I have five cans	0
I think that it would be greater than 24	0
I cant even read that	0
Yes	0
See what will fit on top of both of them	0
Im going to help you with the first one and then youre on your own for the next two	0
Were going to do this	0
Now person number one	0
Standard notation standard form	0
So when youre multiplying  zero that becomes zero and then you have to add one so would you still put down the 1	0
Guys were going to need this the rest of the year	0
What is a tape diagram	0
You need to work	0
So Im going to start the top for each	0
Were looking at lesson 21	0
Nice job	0
Okay so that worked out kind of nicely here	0
Youve got a horizontal asymptote there a vertical asymptote there an xintercept there a yintercept there and a hole there	0
Theyre looking at each other but smiling whenever Asher says something these things are unacceptable so all three of you are going to be back at your seats youre going to get stopping things Im done Im not doing this anymore my one morning done	0
Okay so I have 123 and a fourth	0
So were not using partial sums but Ill use decimal alignment to add decimals	0
This column I started with zero	0
This part is still independent	0
You would have to weigh out Okay	0
If you did tenths try it with hundredths and see	0
Looking at it	0
Now	0
Go	0
Then youre going to do math boxes  on page 223	0
Nice job	0
Then also were working on incentives towards He knows how to hold it its just he slips into that a bit	0
Problem wants to know what year was I born	0
We could definitely add column one to column two	0
Ill give you a hint	0
The bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces	0
There you go	0
Nice job	0
Okay	0
Im just going to go over it with you	0
So if we go to 117 okay	0
6 7 and 8 actually	0
So you substitute you find a piece that that is common that can fit into both of them	0
I just made it yesterday so no one has it yet	0
So over the last weekend it was Presidents Day weekend and a lot of retailers like to take advantage of that and they have really big sales	0
And then I would also recommend for everyone if you use the if you use the text function on Pear Deck it actually makes writing points really quick	0
A month or so ago they wouldve noticed primarily the colors	0
Okay	0
I got rid of those and I got rid of the two 0s on the 50 in the 500	0
Okay and if its over one you dont need to write it as a fraction you can just write it as the number on the top because divided by one this really means negative three divided by one is just negative three	0
Then after were done with Coras were going to switch to mine and see what could be better with mine	0
Six	0
But for some reason I put a one in the hundreds place	0
Okay so 73 times two is 146 I know that the multiplication is correct now I need to place the decimal	0
Okay	0
I want you to just write that to the side on page 11	0
So like those angles are the same	0
It wouldnt work for the whole line because when you put a square root in it it changes whats going on	0
Why dont you tell me first and then if we  need to build a model we may have you come  up and do that	0
Now we talked about that if the thing over here on the other side were both even numbers it might be convenient just divide by two if theyre going to give you fractions its better to just deal with them	0
Sorry	0
So perhaps it would be smart if you copied it	0
Awesome	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
Madam Madam can we	0
Well yes but its taking us too long to complete these problems	0
Youre going to have six parts that you have graphed just like youre filling in six sets of points on there	0
Its about time for this to be done	0
You need to know that that is called the dividend but whats even more important than knowing the name is knowing what it is	0
Great	0
When I can say 3 2 1 hold him up that quick	0
Remember its okay to make a mistake the only thing bad for you to be doing right now is not to be engaging	0
In our last class we talked about the concept of powered numbers	0
Well I would try to do that a little bit smaller	0
OkaySSright	0
Im going to need somebody to walk me through that first problem	0
Thats your shoulder partner	0
Please say	0
Second one draw a horizontal line and mark it off in common increments not colorsYou guys are on the color thing	0
Im going to move it over this way a little bit	0
Could you be Statue of Liberty  Okay you can the Leaning Tower of Pisa	0
Okay	0
I cant take the shortest distance from my classroom to Ms Burnetts starting here	0
I I now I  do	0
Lovely	0
So you best show us what to do	0
Now if I just put a line in the middle	0
Water	0
Then we will watch a section of video on this chapter	0
Come back to your shared screen	0
That makes me happy	0
Okay interesting	0
Yep	0
I noticed that it is the exact same numbers that it was in the last problem	0
So everybody write down three eighths	0
Good observation	0
Look in your notes	0
So lets see what we can do	0
Youre just respecting the fact is when youre on call with me	0
Lets review start with 1A	0
So use what you know too so you dont have to blindly experiment with each of them	0
I think thats what Jessica is asking and Alan and David	0
Okay	0
Whatever answers you did	0
That would be really nice	0
I mean it shows that he really understands	0
Now were going to play blue	0
And this is what the power of 10 would look like	0
Okay	0
I think that sounds about right when I look at our other fractions	0
So I can instead of writing two thousand one hundred fourteen point five	0
I would like you on your white boards to solve this	0
Twothirds of eight were	0
But first complete this without looking then eh check if its right	0
Christian is a 13 and not a 12	0
I have to wait for you every time	0
Know what we learned	0
So this is B hopefully everyone got that one and its negative eight  positive four	0
Tell me overall	0
Sure	0
You are going to order decimals on your whiteboard in order from the least to greatest	0
There it is	0
Try this one	0
We did all of that all of those big numbers and were doing some kind of fun stuff today	0
Thats good	0
What	0
All right make sure you let me know if you have any questions	0
Oh well well cover that later but what it would mean would be that if these rays instead of going in that direction if they went in the opposite direction	0
We are all going to clip up when were done	0
Meaning your chair is facing me	0
In Part B the park is going to be a rectangle with those things as corners those points as corners	0
Why are you making it go down by 2 because thats the slope	0
Thats how you can think about it with a diagram	0
So theyre going to go through this	0
Here	0
Four five and six	0
Three fourths	0
Find out whether its true or not	0
Excellent excellent	0
If we look at it in the same order as we studied it	0
Fifths are green	0
When I create this when Im finding mean I have two ways that I can do it	0
Paul sold eight more than Linda	0
So now this is no different	0
Oh wait	0
You should go by 10s or by 12s I think 12s	0
And I got  mostly when it said one third I got three bows	0
That was your round of warm up were ready to begin the lesson	0
Therefore the shorter way to find this diagonal is length of the box squared plus width of the box squared plus the height of the box squared and at the end extract the root	0
Yeah that would still be a number	0
Okay	0
So shift three place values to the left its like dividing	0
Im going to subtract column one which would be one adult	0
Its not funny	0
Thank you	0
Thats super distracting	0
We know that 9 times 7 is 63	0
These are the hidden points	0
Okay go	0
Oh my gosh	0
Im going to put everybody with a partner to be able to solve this problem	0
First eight Okay	0
And they said  casserole	0
And then I need a different color	0
Oh ok	0
So I know that my equivalent fraction is going to have a twelfth	0
Great	0
No	0
Because its groups of the water bottles	0
21 plus 14 is 35 plus seven is 42	0
By four I get eight 12ths	0
Dont do the big theta do a little theta here and a little theta there	0
Oh wait	0
Therefore I think that you are familiar with this	0
2 in my 10th place and then nine in my 100 place but I have to do the zero decimal zero because I have two in that place	0
And remember the way I found this was I found it in heres a copy of math lesson	0
Its buried	0
Okay	0
He went to the party	0
I want you to explain	0
Okay	0
And if you have a low score on a homework thats a great opportunity to easily get some more points in this class you just need to click similar question and try it again	0
And in here let me know if you have questions obviously	0
Well I started here I jumped over the wall and I went to here	0
Right	0
Really	0
So let me actually write that in	0
Okay you got a misplaced L there	0
However looking at your work I could have selected way more of you	0
Let me give you about one more minute	0
Okay just checking	0
Like we did on the back	0
Welcome everybody	0
I would say that mode probably is not a good representation	0
Guys you have to understand this	0
Thats undefined slope	0
Nope youre changing it thank you	0
A partner at your table	0
Just join a group	0
I want to show you two things before we move on	0
Get out your whiteboard and join me on the floor	0
All right for cruising right along	0
So if its 16 and a half	0
Let me see those statements	0
To help you with some	0
Yeah	0
Do your best	0
Go for it Matt	0
If you go all the way over thats a pretty big angle	0
Just lovely	0
Then would you write it around here	0
Zero 12 or 1	0
You can	0
7 14 21 Her strategy will help us get to the answer a little quicker	0
It sounds like everyone had a pretty good understanding	0
Four	0
Okay	0
And then he spends 2 per week on candy	0
we ignore it	0
Im confused	0
Erase your boards please	0
You do it horizontally	0
Yes	0
So now lets use this	0
Right	0
I will know Im successful when I can justify a rule	0
Okay and then your graph would look something like this	0
I took each of those tenths and multiplied them by 2 to get 20ths	0
So what Im doing is I have the three miles inauidble and I split into fourths because theres four friends	0
Very nice very good its 76	0
Turn and talk to your metome partner and make sure that each others coordinates are six blocks away	0
Thats exactly what we do when we do  bar graph	0
Round up the eight	0
Ok you re both agreeing on that	0
Lets see	0
Yes	0
Dont let them go by so easily	0
Well start with something with a new problem	0
What s that got to do with secrets	0
This is something that you would definitely do to be able to make your recipe bigger or make it smaller	0
And this time I will pick a different T	0
Okay	0
This will be the amount here	0
Okay	0
So lets do some remembering from last week an equivalent fraction for onehalf	0
You have to turn this into an improper fraction	0
It looks almost the same but you can see that the function is not approaching the xaxis its approaching some other horizontal line	0
Okay	0
T is having a breakdown of in the front of the room	0
Okay so Landon if you had to coach me through that you would then say oh Duncan thats the right way to use US traditional multiplication	0
And there are four quarts in a gallon	0
but now if we do minus six X to pass it on this side  to minus two	0
100 we cannot count by 100 to get to 1	0
Discuss with your partner how the problems were similar and difficult	0
Four	0
So this is actually if we have three sets of 34 its going to be greater than one 34	0
Then when I say close your eyes and youre going to pop it up	0
You can get started	0
Allen be helpful	0
Yeah	0
I knew that wasnt the issue	0
I should be able to tell that its you	0
Thats why you need to use the tools	0
My homework	0
Thats part one	0
So I think the trapezoid will be twice this wide because I will multiply the X coordinates by two and that will make the X coordinates twice as large which will move the points to the right	0
15	0
Same as number three	0
Let s see what other people think	0
No	0
I came around	0
Do the next page	0
If you have done a really good job showing your work with your ratio table then thats how you can explain your answer	0
Im thinking because you did it differently thats why you got the wrong answer	0
some of you might use little  dolls or something right or bigger dolls or	0
It shouldnt matter its the same formula	0
Four times two is 8 and two times four is 8	0
I heard such really wonderful things  happened on Friday and I watched a tape on Thursday so I  had to rearrange my schedule so I could be here and Im  just so happy to be here	0
Uh I will teach you a step to solve	0
This	0
Okay	0
If you keep on disrupting then you are disrupting everyone	0
If youre struggling you may talk to your teammates for help or ask myself for help but I would like you all to try to start to do this on your own	0
Okay when you are done I want you to find a quick group to work with just comparing answers to	0
Im still not convinced  that theres not one smaller	0
Three you can still do in principle in the old method	0
Stand up on number one if your answer was no	0
So lets draw the smaller one	0
Well lets look at these	0
I have put squared paper underneath it	0
Okay	0
Just like we did yesterday with adding but subtracting today	0
If you understand the graph it makes sense what we wrote on the table	0
Right	0
Okay no no Im sorry	0
I know but I didn t want to spoil your chance	0
Okay	0
I wish there was Geo	0
One two three	0
All right	0
Nice job explaining that	0
Here you go	0
Okay now lets think about what your slope is	0
Nice	0
Oh good	0
The social studies club wants to make paperma che  globes	0
Right here we can something like add our columns together	0
Sixteen minus five	0
All right today our plan is to talk about subtracting fractions	0
I got it though	0
Start answering the questions	0
Hi	0
And well get there in just a minute	0
Linda sold nine bookmarks	0
Mr Strathom and I are coming around to look at your journals	0
Right	0
Sorry	0
You all know him don t you	0
If we were going to add three dogs plus two cats	0
You cant change what it counts by	0
And then theres an assignment	0
Okay	0
So this time end of the year well go the number eight	0
That one wins	0
If I am correct it should be correct	0
Actually you cant buy another ride	0
What a coincidence	0
Yeah	0
Friends this is going to be a little chaotic this morning	0
Some of you guys	0
If you look I can see exactly what she did she added one plus seven plus four plus six and then her one	0
Im going to have you very quickly	0
When youre mom your dad your aunt your uncle your grandma your grandpa go to the grocery store to buy food for you guys milk is one of the items that are oftentime bought	0
That should work	0
The next thing we need to do is were going to add our whole numbers	0
So it would be easier to write it out in standard form but today were going to go through all of the steps	0
You pay with a 20 dollar bill	0
Alright	0
Okay so your equation is just y equals three for this line	0
Okay	0
It works every time	0
If you guys are both finished you guys can talk about your answer	0
Yeah	0
It wont work	0
That would be 29 hundredths	0
Then we do the zero thousandths minus three  thousandths minus one thousandths so then over here but	0
Originally I was like Oh maybe Ill put the biggest number as I can part of the x	0
All right	0
This is done and done	0
All right	0
And youre going to get an opportunity to share with a partner how you did it	0
Then we have Taras house with four people Brendans house with three Felixs house with four Hectors house with three and Tanishas house with four	0
three pieces	0
And since its negative 28 one of these needs to be negative but we want them to add to positive three	0
You could draw a picture	0
One two three	0
Okay were left with four of these	0
So he has a fruit bar and he already has half	0
Thank you	0
Well there it is	0
All right	0
You might forget the two or you might make an X out of the Y and such things	0
You have to say red blue blue	0
Because all that youre doing is multiplying everything times two and if you are struggling with this you need to work on multiplication	0
Okay thats okay	0
You got it	0
Avery are you going to say something weird	0
So from T to R vertical line from R to A diagonal line	0
Voices off in three two voices off in one and zero	0
So you at least have a little extra time to get going on that	0
Not sure why you are sitting doing nothing	0
Ill just put a little bow over here	0
If we have a good idea of where this other points going to be it needs to be over three from I	0
So were going to go back to that area model	0
Good job	0
All of them	0
Use this little thing	0
So its all the x values that match up with these points	0
Less than equal to	0
So what can I do and were just going to focus on Team 1 first	0
Bye Judy	0
And lets talk about three and four	0
Oh this series	0
We got half of a problem	0
Now looking at my wholes just looking at my wholes I have two whole pizzas colored in	0
All the different steps to solving a problem	0
What I want you to do is I need a couple of friends	0
Its missing 15 before it can be a whole	0
Sum	0
One	0
Yes but I think that it adds a little bit to the answer	0
The bigger my number gets the more that place values I have to have for my numbers	0
That was a trick question	0
So theyre going on this field trip and four students went to the forest preserve and theyre sharing three veggie pizzas	0
Yes	0
I said its about  because 49 is closest to a half and 39 is closes to a half and	0
Thats very helpful	0
Then it  11	0
The radius and the measurement of the circumference is in this relation	0
Maarten whisper	0
Okay well come back to this in just a moment	0
then eh yes  X minus three	0
If we have different names for the same number that might be interesting	0
Listen	0
Well get back to the assignment which was given to you on Thursday	0
Okay	0
And I keep seeing this	0
Number one I want you to write the equation for this function knowing that the slope m is three and the y intercept B is two	0
Thank you very much	0
Lets see if this is F Mark and his friends	0
You dont	0
Yeah if its if paradox ever not working just exit out and then try to click on the link again	0
Okay	0
We also need to have a few points in between	0
No apparently you are not doing this alone	0
Oh my gosh	0
Twentyfive	0
Its easy to learn it but its hard to explain it	0
How is that not right	0
divided by one would be one	0
Are you in a hurry	0
And youre going to do it again	0
Eight A cubed one A cubed	0
Okay	0
Okay so segment pq is congruent to segment qR	0
Oh Im sorry	0
So if you put a comma between that it would be more correct	0
So Im just going to cross this out	0
Right	0
Excellent	0
You you try to draw the uh foursided polygon it is equilateral and it is not equiangular	0
Okay	0
One	0
Very confusing to me	0
Oh that s interesting two different models	0
Notice this is written three four different ways	0
This is your line of reflection on this problem	0
Now whatd you do	0
Okay	0
So heres the question	0
Okay	0
Okay so so lets do a word problem	0
I believe that	0
You guys can go down to your second set	0
Yes the denominator	0
diagonals split angles	0
Great yes	0
Eighteen plus seven is	0
So Im going to stop everybody real quick	0
Cool	0
Oh like number one two three	0
Thirty degrees	0
All right um heres a couple ways to think about it	0
All right	0
What I want you to do is do something	0
Surface area equals four Pi R squared	0
The math method that we did last time  The math method we did last time said using your fraction circle pieces get a 14 piece and a 18 piece and figure out what 14 plus 18 is	0
All right 14  14  14 lets see if we agree	0
If you would join that that would be great	0
It has to equal one there but I see what you were thinking	0
Here is what youre going to do	0
Three divided by three is one	0
So Stephanie came back and Hanka is still absent	0
this thing hanging out here	0
I dont want you to change that	0
So you go like negative two times 10 is negative 20 plus eight is negative 12	0
Okay	0
It says sharing breakfast	0
So Im going to go first Im going to turn over three cards	0
It starts with combine the pasta	0
Oh my gosh	0
The boxes in the diagram show the types of things you do when you use mathematical practices to solve problems	0
But if you have two equations and they each have an x and a y in them then you need to go system	0
Okay	0
Sixty minus B in between brackets	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
A million to the zero power is one	0
Yes	0
This one	0
You guys are great	0
All right	0
So if I have three pizzas and the first two were going to divide in half	0
It needs to have the starting amount and whats happening every week	0
Its in the last page of your packet	0
So separate them out	0
Five in two hundred and eighty nine thousandths is less than five in threetenths	0
The base of the right triangle would be 14 minus 13 divided by tangent 7	0
I will think of a better example and show you tomorrow	0
Sometimes it helps to look at a model  thats a little different	0
Its been able to conceptually look at it and thats what were finding fifth graders are missing as a whole	0
Okay so rise over run you can find the slope okay	0
Of the data	0
In the space up here just write down what you think might be something a fact that you might discover about those angles	0
Well do that a little bit later	0
It is only an equation not an identity	0
Since its hard to see we will make it clearer	0
So I love what you said because you connected what we just did in the last problem with this one	0
Raise your hands if youre going first	0
Oh my gosh so many volunteers	0
Well	0
So yeah I was born in 1980	0
You did it	0
Okay and theres a couple ways its not specific	0
I think you went looking for something specific	0
You can look through there	0
Larry has half of a fruit bar he wants to give half of what he has to his brother	0
Well lets face it you know	0
Hes listening	0
So it has a thousands on here so we couldve done We could have done 248 thousands on here	0
So Camille let me show you what I mean okay	0
Two times	0
Oh	0
Yes thank you very much	0
Ok	0
And draw your perfect corner as perfect of a corner as you can	0
Our second question says Suppose you have 15 milliliters of red paint	0
Were going to set up each of these boxes like the first one	0
Im connecting the coordinate grid 81 to 51 then Im connecting 51 to 57 57 to 12 12 to 51 51 to 01 01 to 20 20 to 70 70 back to 81	0
No you didn t	0
Then Duncan would say okay now I want you to write down	0
It cannot be eliminate eliminated cannot eliminate the X	0
23	0
Oh then it would be 16	0
Oh	0
Right	0
Okay thank you so much for letting me know that in the chat	0
Riley thank you for sharing	0
Oh awesome	0
Im going to create two more bars with four people	0
So here we have one half and two fourths	0
Yeah they all look like that too	0
They are your scores	0
Good question	0
Good	0
You didnt get 152	0
This is not a time to mess around we are serious we get our job done	0
We dont know	0
Sorry	0
So this would be 96	0
This is better	0
This onefourth	0
Thats where we come up with the whole terminology of equivalent fractions	0
And I want you to start making notes in your notebook about how youre going to tackle this problem	0
All right people we got two more to go	0
Okay give me just one	0
This time when X equals negative one over two	0
It is not okay to not understand something and just copy off your friends	0
Thats a good question Roger	0
You would have to say oh that s extremely straight	0
So you might be thinking to yourself well like Look these y values are repeating like theres two fives and two threes	0
You have three different ones	0
If you think its 19 and we would figure out how much for one violin you going to be taking take 19x4	0
It would only take you three steps	0
You cant have anything in the three hundreds	0
Otherwise I would have to explain it all by myself once again	0
Maths Boxes  very next page	0
You must do to the top	0
We cannot make any more full bags of marbles because it takes five marbles to fill up one bag	0
Okay	0
The chapter on slopes	0
Im multiplying them by the same	0
One two three four five six	0
You turned it off	0
So I cannot wait to see this	0
Or it could be negative in the front three over four	0
Were going to see if we can do it both ways	0
So we have this	0
In fact the present method is using the same technique too	0
Okay	0
R represents walking rate	0
Okay but the his rule One one second hang on	0
That  was a hard one	0
I made a mistake	0
Lets make this smaller	0
Where to put one tenth	0
But we really mean two children fishing at  a little dock not out in the ocean somewhere where we expect the  fish to be smaller but youre right youre absolutely right Michael it  could be	0
And in this case it goes up to over three	0
So Im going to divide both of these by three	0
Equals 263	0
For tangent which is the blue guy it was  2 and 3  2	0
Seven	0
xavier is on exactly the right vocabulary page that I would expect everyone to be on	0
Thats Okay	0
Okay	0
Well there it is	0
We keep pushing it down but it keeps coming back	0
And then or it could be up to over eight	0
Oh that was great	0
Yes	0
Your friends location is also seven blocks from the boat rental	0
Okay	0
Now Im going to show you guys what its going to look like first	0
Ok	0
Do we have to use the rectangle	0
Yeah cause I put it	0
You should carry from Hold on	0
Lets talk about this one lets talk about this one real quick	0
Youre making up the assignments	0
youre just going to take three charts one through nine	0
There we go	0
Thats why I wanted No no youre writing an estimate problem that youre going to be able to easily add	0
There s five turns	0
Were not telling jokes right now	0
Recommended updates	0
Green	0
But according to their rule its what it should be	0
But we are going to apply this learning and extend on this learning to the why and the how	0
And then Falicia and Melissay wrote this one y equals 15x plus one	0
And they want me to model it a different way	0
61400 round to the nearest whole number	0
Then I have my 600000	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Well done	0
When your group is done please have a seat on the ground wherever youre at just have a seat	0
I am about to do attendance	0
Oh man	0
I see a lot of you have some ratio tables for number one	0
Danny	0
Well see do you have to call the orange two	0
And its okay to not know but Im about to show you	0
And Esme is right	0
It shows us that he understood that multiplying something by 100 gave him a larger number than the dividend	0
Thank you fifth graders	0
abbreviated y intercept is 03	0
There you go	0
All right	0
If you don t do that you have made an illegal substitution	0
So then how are you gonna show me since you tell me that if I add these two thats gonna be the answer	0
Draw a line through them	0
This ought to be enough for our lecture	0
Okay	0
Yeah I want you to bring how you solved two sixths plus 14	0
Yeah I love this strategy	0
Halley can you please collect all the straw pieces from the tables	0
Cool	0
So Im going to take yellow and Im going to shade one two parts of that	0
8530	0
Perfect	0
And loading loading loading	0
Think it out	0
I want to be just certain that I undeTeachertand exactly what youre seeing here	0
Okay	0
Four more	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Dont freak okay	0
Okay you can go ahead and close your Chromebook we dont need it right now	0
The winners	0
Audrey is not here	0
Were going to count until these match up with each other	0
Thats alright Zachary it sounds like you can hear this for right now	0
One third	0
All right were looking super good on these so far	0
Okay	0
Bicycling	0
So were going to compare those two things	0
Three plus three plus three is going to be nine which equals threefifths of 15	0
All right	0
Okay who wants to come up tell me where you think you should put it	0
Okay	0
S equals minus five	0
Theyre all the same	0
That was awesome	0
Look at the pattern	0
Its like you have two lines and we put the arrow like that	0
Just uh the no youve got it already its already here the multiplication table	0
So you kind of said to yourself oh I need to get the dressing from 7 to 28	0
Oh there	0
Okay and we ll have to review that in the morning	0
It seems to me that all the groups have understood what the method was lets say to apply	0
Hold up eight fingers for me	0
Thats what Im saying	0
Ah its really bad dont	0
I did not say you can draw whatever you want on your whiteboard	0
thats what I want to make sure	0
But look at A it says estimate B answer C number model with unknown	0
Oh whats happening	0
Starting with 65 hundredths	0
Here you have the same main number and the exponent here just the main number and here well work with the same exponents	0
Yeah	0
Lets put this y equals 40	0
But because its not a cone were missing this little piece down here	0
Twelve multiplied by three and a  two	0
In	0
So you could just use an algorithm to do it	0
If I gave you a blank one of these	0
Yeah	0
You can stand together	0
All right lets get ready to do the next one	0
Okay	0
Im going to divide my numerator and my denominator by two and that leaves me with onefourth	0
Okay lets go to 49 Okay	0
So were going to jump down to the next one	0
Very good	0
Absolutely	0
Youre going to be doing a diagram and words	0
Please go back to your seats	0
But she understood this	0
Oh okay	0
Theyre angles formed by secants and tangents	0
And we need to name two other quantities of plate	0
Perimeter of a circle or the distance of a circumference thats a difficult question	0
Im going to talk about whats good and bad about each of these and then Im going to tell you which one I would start with	0
I wonder how many all of you can mak make	0
I dont really know	0
I think that these are last ones so after 102 you go to zero and two	0
You should have one in your circle so everybody put one yellow piece in your circle	0
Okay	0
And I want you to think about if each of these problems requires rate of common factor or least common multiple you do not need to solve the problem	0
Twelfths	0
Mikes age if Mike is three years older than Jill	0
On any piece of paper	0
All right	0
Stand up push your chairs in	0
So its 40 plus one you get 41	0
Okay	0
Second know how to think symmetry of the circle to generate in test identities	0
Great	0
Yes you did	0
Excellent	0
I would like you to look at this	0
I know youre joking just a little bit but this we cant tell skewed from this because look at this graph up here	0
So the estimate if I have two and three tenths and seven and six tenths	0
I can form ordered pairs graph them and interpret coordinate values in context	0
Between three and four would be three and one half and the same on the negative  side	0
Chromebooks	0
Thats it	0
Okay	0
I would like us to start with some mental math	0
And Im going to take away the tables take away the graphs and were just going to see if we can find slope when I tell you what the two points are	0
I need a new whiteboard please	0
We have that makes it sound like its Halloween	0
Just three cents three cents three cents	0
Dont forget youve gotta end up with a minimum of three in each	0
We talked about the area is length times width and perimeter is length plus width plus length plus width	0
Yes	0
Now you can see were getting closer	0
Yes	0
No you dont	0
Because you got it right there	0
So a fraction of problem is this	0
34 hundredths	0
You never want to get into a habit of Oh I saw the word of I m just going to multiply	0
So she said that were going to go from the 200 And thats a racer	0
My God	0
Well an X plus something squared	0
But when its on the upper side than it is plus	0
And Ill stop presenting for right now	0
Suppose we changed it for a different purpose	0
Laura can you unmute	0
So youre looking for a low numerator and a high denominator to let you know that its a smaller fraction	0
Thirteen	0
We gotta check it	0
If I put five in I ve got twentyfive	0
There is but its on the table	0
Minus 19 when theres plus seven it makes minus 12	0
So	0
Hm	0
So you wrote it and then multiplied it	0
Were going to do this one quickly	0
Enough message	0
Here are your directions	0
So the answer is three fifteenths	0
Well skip that one for today	0
Thats a lot	0
Youre not going to know how to do it	0
Thats always our first number	0
Okay	0
See if you can put that comma where it goes	0
You want to switch that around	0
So what that means is when we get ready to go over to that second place value the tens we have to physically move our numbers over that much	0
Were going to land in between two pieces of data so the number in between 1 and 2 would be 15 or one and a half	0
I think of this as a little monster that has horns	0
What	0
No problem	0
Thank you Kara	0
So either one of these number models will work	0
If you put these in a fraction negative four over two negative four divided by two thats the same thing	0
No that s too easy let s see	0
Youre going to get to try a few more problems	0
If you took one off there were a lot more  blocks to deal with	0
Step five repeat	0
Were going to do 28 divided by five	0
Good job	0
Right now the domain is the set of all of the exes of a function	0
Yes	0
So start drawing our square	0
I agree with the dog because	0
Now the dimensions of the shaded rectangle	0
You  were all wonderful	0
All right	0
Guys look up	0
What you need right now is youre going to need your whiteboard and you are going to need Well you may not even need your whiteboard	0
Tomorrow were not learning anything new because theres something else going on	0
Oh because Ive done my job	0
If I can show you the purple youre going to be using your fraction circles	0
Next one 37 should go right there	0
The prefix mis means not or the opposite of	0
Nice job friends	0
Thank you Haven good job	0
Oh I can see it	0
I thought tan negative theta	0
You can work apart I dont really want you to be talking about what youre doing	0
No	0
Think about that in turns	0
Five four three two one zero	0
Those of you in the room you have a worksheet that looks like this those of you at home I hope you are turned open to your next clean page in your notebook	0
Two fifths of students three tenths of students theyre both a fraction of the number of students	0
This is a reference to help you	0
Very good	0
Think about what your partner is saying and validate his thinking because his thinking was right on	0
You need to put that in your pocket or put it away or put it on your wrist	0
Im going to walk around and see whats happening on everyones boards	0
Please go to page 148 in your math journal	0
Then the pouches and nine	0
If we take away 1 we should end up with 23	0
Thats a three	0
Right	0
You said divide eight by two	0
Incorrect you need to reverse the numbers	0
So we are going to act normal as usual	0
And I think this bitmojis is so funny	0
Youre intelligent	0
Get started once you get it please	0
Im sorry	0
Gwen your cover is open	0
Okay great	0
I just want you to be able to say that	0
Camden	0
Which makes 89	0
All right	0
I did M	0
Dont go any further	0
Were just going to try to ignore that	0
Six dollars	0
Hunter	0
So I have a variety of answers	0
Because it was not neat and it was kind of small	0
All right	0
Graph the corresponding points we might say plot the points and see what you can discover about meerkats	0
Half of a up arrow	0
Well lets take another look	0
That word is interpolate	0
I can tell your wheels are turning	0
Youre welcome	0
These are just names you know you may also keep calling this the long side no problem	0
The first number will always tell us how far well travel on the xaxis	0
So thats all normal there	0
But just remember this means that if you want to go from the x column to the Y column you go times four	0
I keep using	0
Yes	0
Heres Lillian	0
Hugo I cannot see yours showing up	0
Another day we were talking about cartoon size folders	0
And then I count by fives nine times and I got 45	0
Dan sit up	0
That ones gonna go there	0
All right found it	0
It doesnt	0
No the the one with the numbers	0
You and your partner need to very very quickly find a place in the room where you can work together	0
If you are done you are waiting patiently for your partner or partners to be done then when youre both done or all three done then you need to compare	0
So it says Here is a diagram that represents this situation	0
Then itll be taller	0
And you will complete all of the homework	0
You can	0
Thank you	0
Im going to join another breakout room	0
And that is what has gone wrong here too	0
Ok now Im wondering if some of you can pull aside and  maybe the rest of you can come up and Id like Jessica and  Andrew to say it nice and loud so in back of the room the  people who are sitting could hear	0
Does anyone have a pen	0
Oh I love it when Im the star	0
Soprocess	0
Dont worry about it being the same answers	0
I mean of 12	0
Good	0
This time I want you to make an estimate for a half plus a third	0
Okay	0
Think about what Aiden said about a fourth plus a half	0
You can just write 12W instead of  12	0
Awesome thinking	0
Mhm yes	0
In your home situation most likely you wouldnt look at the thirty point five seven	0
When this point reaches the equation then here you have the measurement of the circumference	0
So we can just multiply across	0
I love that Cannon said the first thing he did was five times four	0
So youre right there	0
This is very important to understand what you have so really think about what youre looking at	0
So you guys keep working I will bring this around	0
Ive erased because of the decimal with	0
Okay	0
Were starting at the origin	0
Yeah if you subtract them its going to be zero	0
Just put it there	0
Ok go ahead	0
Theres still a couple people who have some missings especially from homework eight	0
Great	0
Theres the difference between that question and number one	0
All right	0
You learned about two squared and two cubed	0
to represent	0
Yes	0
I have one	0
I know you cant take two away  You cant take four away from two	0
So I want those two things to be in your notebook	0
Were going to start with the people that thought Sadie was right	0
Yeah I see what youre saying	0
Yes	0
If youd like to use a graph paper  that was helpful	0
The really cool thing about Pythagoras and what he did was he looked at a lot of music and the way that notes and what we know about music today is like a lot from Pythagoras	0
There is no secret	0
Were going to talk about that a little bit at the end of the class today	0
How come	0
If the I was in front of	0
Which of both of you wants to write today	0
All right	0
I notice 35 start from here so I need to shade in to 35	0
Okay	0
However your multiplication is wrong	0
LOM is congruent to	0
Thank you Haley	0
Thank you	0
Now we said improper fraction and if we did that we would get 1 78 because we pull out 88 and 78 because 87 15	0
And then youre going to complete nine 10 and 11 and choose one of the problems there and show how you solve it using a grid	0
Okay and another thing you could write is nonlinear because its not consistent	0
So I am going to make sure that you do not have to	0
Yeah	0
Wait	0
Everyone else who sees it they would be like Phoebe worked on this problem	0
Go to a zero	0
I get it	0
All right thats a few	0
Yes	0
Hold up your fingers right now if you feel like youre Remember a one is you dont understand at all	0
So right now I would like you to do this on your dry erase board	0
Think of it like negative discovery three over three	0
Return to main call	0
Oh	0
I have seven fifths	0
I think I know why	0
I know but it says that you have 141 tickets and nine on your table	0
All right	0
While in the assignment it is suggested that you end up with a plus	0
At 13 you will get a few more	0
Another 20 groups will fit into 100 and then 8 groups of 5 will fit into 40	0
And you know that factors play into that	0
Then you should be seated	0
We have found twofifths and fourfifths	0
We re going to read this as a class	0
So some of them might have six	0
And then we add a zero	0
So if you want to use the student work to help find the solution you will have a little bit more time in class to kind of answer these questions	0
Me	0
Im pretty well	0
For every text were going to charge you one cent or something like that but now theyre just like Yes	0
were all fine	0
Now its the computers turn	0
Did you erase this	0
Then everybody else youre going to try it on your own for just a bit and youll have a chance to work with a partner	0
The most important thing to me right now is your estimate	0
Okay	0
Look at the colors above my candy bar	0
I did it like this	0
And then our last one	0
Okay	0
Oh I multiplied my divisor times that number	0
Okay erase your boards clean	0
Show me your answers	0
Let me go back here	0
Okay so super small angle all the way up to perfect corner	0
But Miss Lauries saying she didnt do that	0
3 inches 2 inches then we have 2x 3 x 5  30 cubic inches  3	0
All right you have about 20 minutes to get this done	0
Hmm	0
Second one that we knew Oh	0
You start shopping for a while	0
Anything else	0
Refocusing	0
Yes	0
There s some different answers going on here	0
Yes in just a minute	0
Uh	0
We have most of the technological things figured out	0
Im looking for factors that are the same	0
So if you started with X you do the opposite of X for your new point	0
Yeah	0
Youre showing me	0
I just had a sub for two days   everything is but what were going to do is well you dont have this sheet either	0
Okay	0
To get from 12 to 36 we had to multiply by three and then seven times three is 21	0
A pot	0
Uhhum	0
Thank you	0
Maybe you have something else to share	0
All right	0
There you go there you go	0
Yes	0
Yes exactly mhm	0
And then 910 1112 so and all Brenda that 12 hour pizza	0
Okay	0
We know we go at least 10 times	0
I have 12 of 21 responses	0
Who did you work with	0
We had a twoday 510 lesson	0
You know that it was in the textbook huh	0
Thank you	0
Yes	0
So maybe its better to do the other way on this one	0
Look at all those fractions that we have that are equivalent to one half	0
56 is the one Im looking for today	0
Okay	0
Tuesday	0
If you pick just the easiest question from each section do you think youre going to feel very prepared for  the quiz tomorrow	0
Im going to have Jaden youre going to walk over and be with Jonathan	0
Can we not please	0
I bet that was so fun	0
All right	0
If the ends of the sides touching the ground are one point five meters apart from each other	0
First thing Im going to shade 34	0
Alexa I want you to work with me please	0
Measure of angle two here	0
We know that gorillas probably dont live to be hundreds of years old or even thousands	0
Two times A plus B	0
Well you dont have to write down	0
That s where the Carte in Cartesian comes from	0
Same thing turn kneetoknee	0
So now that we did that one I want you to write the following one down in your journal and I want you to see if you can solve it without me helping you	0
Based off that measurement up there that pencil is not even two inches and they shouldnt be using it	0
I brought you up here because I want to set you up for success	0
that will be helpful	0
It wasnt as bad as you thought it was	0
I want you to answer the question Im about to give you	0
Then you go 5	0
Youll pick a formula that is suited for this problem	0
The items inside parenthesis come first in the order of operations	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
You have some fast mental math strategies	0
Great	0
Okay	0
So then we have 10 times 23	0
Nicole did you do your homework	0
You have your fourteen and your five	0
Okay	0
you can do whatever you are comfortable with	0
Okay so repeating what you said	0
Crew here are your answers from last night from your homework	0
Come on over Riley	0
Yeah we wouldnt want to	0
You are going to write which value of these fractions is larger all the way down	0
You got that one then you connected those	0
Guys watch	0
Is it okay if I go	0
If you have props and if you dont then just go out and take a picture	0
All right	0
No because yours does not look like mine it is not folded in	0
Okay	0
Were working on a science project	0
The model is the multiplication problem the area is the product	0
Okay	0
So lets do a couple questions that go together	0
There you go	0
exactly	0
PAGE 63 turn it on to journal page	0
in your backpack	0
What did you notice as you added different colors of shading to your grid	0
Since Ichiros wallet becomes empty and	0
Wedges	0
Okay	0
is three and a half	0
Remember the big part of todays lesson is do I understand what this information is telling me	0
Yes	0
Yeah	0
Six one halves	0
There was no other thing	0
As a reminder a unit rate is I dont think its tracking thats okay	0
Okay so f of four	0
Put A equals 14 into this um either one of the equations	0
And you get this	0
The number three is against the law	0
Yeah	0
I want to talk to the people I want everyone to be quiet for a second and I want to talk just to the people who are sure absolutely sure they don t know any secrets	0
Six zeroes is a million million place value	0
Yes Im raising it now	0
I want to see a clear number sentence with an answer as well	0
So all your steps  and do your best work today	0
They try to say like a big new story	0
Thats what I was waiting for you to say	0
Turn them off yes	0
No there is indeed no way you could know that yet	0
Shes gone for five days	0
Our next one says were going to go back here and we are going to multiply thank you	0
So the y intercept is zero negative four	0
Okay so this one is eight  and four plus four is plus one	0
And and then thats going to be pretty much our last topic for today	0
Theres four lines on each of it	0
Nine minus seven equals two two times three equals six six times four equals 24	0
Okay	0
Oh we do have the slant length of the cone	0
Okay	0
Thank you for not erasing until you checked it against whats on the board	0
616	0
So if you bisect you split it into two congruent parts	0
Because we want to know how far she can go on one gallon of gas	0
It Apolo one half	0
So on number five we	0
F of three equals seven same exact thing	0
No somebody hasnt gone	0
Yes exactly	0
Do it on your whiteboard make a decision	0
Words numbers	0
But Sir	0
Thats how you do one of those	0
But if you can call it one you could call  those halves	0
Theyre taking part thank you	0
Read it to me	0
It helps you to place those  numbers	0
I already did it	0
Yes	0
Sure	0
Id say a half	0
Okay so function notation so these two equations are exactly the same	0
Um do you remember I mentioned before in the last two classes that you should have learned it seen it in primary school	0
Which is really slow	0
For these well kind of see what we can figure out	0
Let me check real quick so Im not sure	0
Zero point zero nine	0
Equivalent	0
Okay only the first number though	0
So if you didnt hear what Mr Brody said he said that you have 10 candy bars remember like that piggy guy what was his name in the video we saw	0
Look at how my numbers are lined up	0
Three vases four flowers	0
Okay Stephen make sure you click that link	0
You can add one	0
my denominator is three	0
Very good and thats the way they are the same	0
Okay if 2x equals four y x equals two y	0
Doesnt work	0
Well thats no use	0
Okay	0
So what that means is it could be a kite and do my best to sketch out a kite	0
You do not know how many carrots he has	0
So one fourth plus one eighth	0
Thank you I appreciate that	0
506 x 4	0
About	0
I think Romina knows what Im looking for	0
You have a math message	0
Heres how youre going to think about this	0
All right	0
I dont know why that works that adding faster	0
Okay	0
You got it	0
I agree and disagree because when I did this I added and I multiplied 8X22 then I did that answer from	0
A whole number	0
Well done	0
Oh my	0
So then the last step is to bring down	0
Its my birthday	0
And you can also use a number line	0
You need to go through every single one of these steps as youre solving	0
Excellent	0
Round these two up number	0
Okay I wanna see what we come up with for this one	0
By them setting it up it allows you to work the problem out	0
Thats fine	0
Im good	0
Lets put in the points that we know	0
Yeah	0
We had our equation	0
Okay	0
So thinking about factors of six it would be 612 1824 3036	0
On a large	0
Because the area	0
Awesome	0
I dont want you to add it this way	0
Thats student A this is student B	0
Okay	0
Lets try another one	0
Let s do number eight first	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Bullet point it on your whiteboard	0
In that case its just one six so thats it	0
Stay standing if Ive called on you	0
There you go	0
Okay	0
Negative eight N	0
Come on	0
Ehm Mam	0
Those of you in MacLand Im going to give you a partner real fast	0
So dont stop at like x equals six	0
Its all related	0
And we know the hypotenuse	0
Four eighths plus two eighths	0
maths journals	0
It doesnt matter	0
All right	0
Yes	0
Ill show you	0
Yeah	0
Yeah	0
Go	0
How cool	0
Because the denominators five	0
Thats the function of G the left element	0
Think for a minute	0
Good	0
I kind of thought that was neat to  show me all the different pieces of the line	0
You may sit down now	0
36 is what I need	0
My sister wasnt very responsible	0
So thats step number one	0
Take a look at those fractions	0
You have tententh minus tententh	0
Lets just review that	0
25 my bad	0
Yes on some and no on some	0
So Im going to write it here	0
Perfect	0
Right	0
My friends that are on a knee stand up	0
If you minus that from the first number and that s how you get the times sign	0
All right	0
Should we go onto the next one	0
You could represent it as a model	0
One has 5 to 2 and the other one has 2 to 5	0
Its looking a lot like this one this circled drawing  but we dont know if	0
Then I will ask	0
In 3 2 1 and 0	0
Thats right	0
Very good	0
Now here go to My Documents	0
Heres where you make your mistake	0
Yes	0
Ive got to understand what it is	0
Test or paper	0
Okay so weve got triangle A D is congruent to D F And we got one more letter	0
Switch roles	0
With a partner double or do your thing	0
So lets see	0
Thats why itll be the case that you can buy this many 200yen cakes	0
I dont want to have to redo the whole setup it takes a while	0
Its the whole area square yes so youre right its the fraction	0
Then I used other papers to grade it to make sure	0
Okay	0
On Wednesday they made 846	0
Mojo the monkey has two whole bananas and five half bananas	0
Okay the answer is a thumbs up 78 x 3	0
I would like you to try this one over here on your own	0
Im not seeing anything after you came up with zero	0
Okay I need another recorder to come on up	0
Shouldnt have phones out	0
Not sure what youre doing out there Asher and Latoya	0
So that is where we are headed to not only be able to prepare groups using ratios but to provide the equivalent ratios as well	0
Break up your piece	0
A half	0
Okay lets see how were doing here	0
Then you may go	0
You don t need to talk Edwin	0
Eyes on me in five four three two one zero	0
Just want to say a couple things because before I throw in the next assignment as well so this is all related to what we just did in class	0
Im almost done with it	0
Everybody look at this number line	0
Okay	0
We have one more	0
Sorry one second	0
Therefore I know Im going to finish this sentence the farmer put five carrots on the partially filled tray	0
310 is right there and then we cant graph the other one	0
Well talk about more of them this afternoon	0
The first thing that you need to do is to put your homework in a place where youll be able to find it	0
You added a zero	0
Its	0
Clay stop moving	0
I want you to think about then what Clay said	0
That is an area model	0
That means that theres going to be 207 people who participate	0
So whenever I read a division problem I read it starting with the dividend the dividend is always the first number inside the house	0
I need you to write the two minus eight not just five	0
I think that you will like to come out today	0
Hm	0
Okay that ones right	0
Five	0
Okay we need to do this first one together	0
Okay	0
You are using models and strategies to multiply decimal numbers	0
Sixtythree 24 eight negative six plus nine positive three three times negative nine negative 27	0
If you interpreted it that way thats okay	0
We have 32 as our whole	0
Look at what these are counting by	0
Do we solve it	0
This needed to connect with that	0
You try	0
Okay let s stop and talk for a minute	0
Remember writing a word down that this numbers place value is in	0
Friends area model is to evaluate	0
He used the box and triangle notation to write the formula	0
So we have 18  2 14 which equals 20 14	0
Right now I need you to put your pencil in the spine of your note catcher and then close your note catcher	0
Yes	0
Therefore theres none	0
Next question	0
Oh thank you and then do we have to have one for every	0
Normally theyre only Tuesdays but you can come in tomorrow morning if you feel I can help you with stuff	0
All right Ts impatient So lets see here	0
All right	0
Its twelve	0
All right	0
No its too big	0
It follows the necklace	0
Mr Haley you are up next	0
Were showing the relationship between two things	0
Youre going to have to demonstrate a couple of ways today	0
Oh	0
That is a lot of fractions and numbers	0
That was your trick for today	0
And do you want to see what I revised	0
The second one I gave you a y	0
What I would like for you to do is each of you do your style that you think will work best	0
I know In between the middle and the three	0
1 2 3 4  a half yeah or a 4 or a 3	0
You can start by saying Something that is the same is and then Something that is different is	0
Go	0
Okay	0
It was a different question	0
The slope is zero and then you add two for the y intercept	0
I need you go look at my partnerships	0
7 times five is 35	0
We would have a great difficulty determining the area of a square	0
another 3	0
But	0
Im going to Newcastle	0
You were about to say one of the secrets	0
Whats the difference between a mayor and a president	0
Okay	0
14 24 34 34	0
If you have the number of three here then you take two X to the right	0
Show me a fifth plus a 10th	0
Might have to take a moment to reload this	0
Really	0
From the Mars Bar company that says that theyre going to	0
So you are on page 131 in your math journal and youre looking at the town map thats also right here	0
Seven plus seven plus seven	0
We know theyre equal because u is the midpoint	0
This ones two comma zero	0
I am not going to ask you again	0
We need mixed numbers so we can subtract fractions	0
Okay	0
Have a great end of class finish off the day	0
I know theres a lot of stuff on this page	0
So I come down here this is going to be one times two is two and two times two is four	0
Triple the second number	0
Yes	0
So we are going Well Ill just do it up here	0
Just a second its refreshing	0
No	0
Zoey if I have nine wholes dont I need nine hundredths to subtract my seven and then Im going to need a grid with my hundredths and thousandths to do the decimals	0
Yes but we have	0
Some of you drew lines which is okay	0
Right	0
Jacob that goes back at your desk please whats in there	0
I did	0
You have got to keep track of things	0
Good and now you have an expression which cant be added together	0
You guys they used the 12 times as much	0
All right	0
Well try that again	0
Right	0
But same equation 3x plus two	0
And you sort of did it spontaneously	0
Okay	0
How about you	0
The examples that we are going to focus on today are going to use diagrams which is like a number line or a tape diagram that you have been working so hard on	0
Okay when you are done writing you need to actually answer three four and five on this page and draw your book	0
Because 73 is closer to 70 than to 80	0
Clear and enter	0
And have a great Thursday afternoon	0
I want original sailboat not the grid	0
184 now SS give me  a thumbs up when you are ready	0
That would be one way it would not work	0
Put it down and put it up	0
That rod would have  length two twelfths	0
1 2 3	0
No	0
Freeze	0
Youre taking a fraction of a fraction and expressing it	0
You guys are becoming experts at plotting your points and filling in the graph making your lines	0
He has three cages and wants to put the same number of rabbits in each cage	0
Youre going to say whatever I say starting now	0
Mmmmm	0
So he said if you added two thirds and then you you added this half to it hes saying its going to be more than that	0
All right	0
Yes	0
I was just pick them up and dropping them	0
Please go meet with a partner of your choice	0
I want to see a complete sentence there	0
Sometimes its easier to just leave it as a fraction	0
Sorry	0
The right answer is D	0
Im right about that	0
Fraction multiplication problems you already know how to do that	0
Okay	0
Michael	0
Yeah	0
All right yeah	0
Yes write the little two on the top	0
It lies in this corner over here and it lies in that corner over there	0
Nope I only want you to do it in your journal	0
So what you write down is 15	0
And try to shorten it Bram	0
Let me stamp it please	0
The reason you are not writing this is I want yours to be done the right way	0
Okay segment pq is congruent to segment qR	0
Keep it to yourself	0
Okay where did it go	0
Look at the problem 13 of 18	0
And we went back to online and then had all of October happened and all that kind of stuff and did writing linear functions	0
Shes 60 because she was about 59 and 3 something inches	0
Two people have shown me that I was wrong	0
Take a good look at the term and maybe think a little about our factorizing forceps	0
Okay	0
So divide	0
Yes San Fran decimals	0
Yes	0
Yes very nice thanks	0
Day after tomorrow	0
So kind of like Ismeal describesThere we go oh my gosh its pen and paper itll work	0
So its important that you realize that you can go back and like actually do better from an old mistake	0
Focus	0
You dont need to do this on yours but I just want to show you this	0
But its from Theodore Roosevelt Teddy Roosevelt a former president but believe you can and youre halfway there	0
lie to people who dont know how numbers work	0
Juliet call on someone else to do the next step	0
The answer is the same but if I write it the other way is there any difference	0
You got the first part done	0
Oh give me five	0
All right so go ahead and do it for the next two please	0
So were going to write times three just to show what were doing on our ratio table	0
This one and its negative 35 and 02	0
Um nothing is on the next few nights	0
Uhhuh	0
So you take your second Y1	0
The first one is one that I know Aaron likes to use	0
I did	0
I practice all day for you guys	0
If you flip flop numbers its going to come out inaccurate	0
Oops	0
But you flip your slope and change the sign	0
Okay	0
Four would be all the way over here	0
If you want to join them together  you should use the red	0
No	0
Okay	0
Uhhuh	0
Okay so heres what I would like you to do guys using my numbers that are up here I want you somewhere on that sheet as a team to write two intelligent things that you can say about the comparison of the heights of theSSin these two classes	0
Ten percent of 100 is 10	0
I told you	0
Right	0
So for every number take half of that number and make a ladder with that many steps	0
I play football not basketball	0
But this side Im not worried about	0
Okay so its the same thing if you have the little triangles or the big triangles because if you do negative two over one you get your slope is still negative two same thing is negative for over two	0
We have the y intercept and the slope hopefully you can write the equation right away	0
Okay	0
Im not bringing in a casserole to celebrate your good behavior because I love you but I dont want to Yes like you get chains and then were going to have a great party	0
So I would call this one list equivalent fractions	0
So the answer would be yes	0
They multiplied both by six	0
No	0
Yeah so I	0
Were gonna graph those points	0
Okay	0
You solved it using common denominators but you didnt draw a model	0
But some of you are going to get this really quickly especially those of you that are really good at your math facts already	0
One of those is segments line segments and angles	0
Theyre going to be up here	0
We havent talked about this	0
Okay good David	0
Nope that ones not in here	0
We could think real big	0
Im not going to tell you what the right answer is	0
Yeah	0
You were going to round 87 and three tenths to the nearest whole number	0
I just want to hear you talk	0
Nice try over here honey	0
Thats a great explanation	0
so I estimate we know that the fraction three eighths is closer to four eight so we round it to a half	0
Well 5  5	0
One and one fourth	0
I like that I see some groups making a table first	0
Okay Danny has a collection of 45 shells	0
Because guys here we go	0
He did	0
Okay I see that a lot of you got your first three	0
One hundred and eighty degrees 180 degrees	0
You have six points here	0
Okay	0
50 will work	0
Cat is correct because cat says we can make five whole pieces	0
Oh thats right	0
I know I know you can do this	0
Alexander look up here	0
But just so you know what Im going to talk about were going to kind of start with the graph and then talk about the table	0
Everybody	0
Either both of the rightangled sides will be given or perhaps only the rightangled side and the hypotenuse will be given	0
I was just raising hand to share	0
Thankfully were not going to look at them all together	0
This one multiplied by two will become two and that one is two	0
Thats 76	0
A number sentence is like were going to add numbers like 60 plus 2 and then we can put that as a number sentence to say that it will  to make it happen	0
Connect them	0
Your median your value in the middle	0
So	0
That s a really neat idea that s a really neat idea	0
And again guys this is going to tell me how many problems I have later on	0
Good morning um	0
To get 9	0
Ones that are same as the area of this	0
Maybe another teachers have you do a rally coach	0
I flinched a little bit	0
Remember n is the figure number S is the number of squares	0
I hope this is bringing back some good fuzzy memories that are not fuzzy anymore	0
I have a strategy for solving the 8 one	0
No you didnt	0
In my notebook	0
Absolutely	0
I think its sometimes helpful as were going from away from the drawing and more and more into what it looks like mathematically to remind yourself like this is the figure number	0
The denominator of six works	0
Yes	0
Mathlans I will see you this afternoon	0
No its a phone	0
On your own you are going to solve this problem and explain your strategy to a partner not until I say though	0
Okay	0
Good	0
Now draw the line	0
It was a large square with four small squares inside it	0
Now lets go and just move this up a little bit	0
I will Give you like 10 more seconds if youre not done thats just gonna have to be	0
Laura wanted it right there between zero and one half she did not want to put it between	0
This whole thing is your 18	0
Ill make it in a second	0
X equals fifteen over four	0
So the mean is number 9	0
So again heres a good review	0
Miss Isla you said that two thirds was larger so Im going to let you solve this problem	0
If you want to make up an easy question you can find a bit of a relationship between the ratio and the amount	0
All right	0
Ill be right there guys	0
So we have twothirds and nine	0
I know you know this Seth	0
I do not want you to spend a bunch of time making really nice pouches and really nice coins	0
Hang on for just a minute	0
Awesome give Charlotte a power clap one two three clap	0
Distribute this one and then put the rest in the extra papers	0
Seven	0
10	0
You have to think about reasonableness	0
three fifths	0
Okay so I have a question to ask	0
Yep	0
I need you seated	0
Were talking about rotation and angle measures	0
What	0

Whose group were you in	0
Dont worry about the camera dont worry about the camera	0
Yeah it tells me how many zeroes to include	0
I did a bar model for the dog	0
Because two times three is six	0
Its going to give you some trig function thats a reciprocal trig function	0
Riley I might have one just actually Riley you can come be Evans partner here	0
Okay	0
Oh you dont like that	0
This one	0
Ok	0
Okay	0
Mhmm	0
If youve got any statistical data already there press Clear	0
Lets go see what person three does	0
But it doesnt	0
Im multiplying a fraction by a whole its going to give me a fraction which is always smaller than my whole number	0
Good	0
So if you forget what those are just take a look in their review sheets youre allowed to use these on the test	0
Okay	0
We re going to have to stop I m afraid because of time	0
Well no I just	0
Those are all equivalent fractions were doing the same thing to all sides	0
All right we are going to stop there for now	0
So were finding answers to a multiplication problem using specifically area model	0
Youre supposed to be doing this one	0
Oh look I know that that is five	0
You decide which one youre going to do the me side which stands for me or the Hadley side which stands for Hadley	0
I saw that it was equal because I wasnt sure at first	0
Do it like this maybe Cut the straw that you measured the one placed on the base	0
Estimation is super important	0
Seven and eight onehundredths please and round it to the nearest tenth	0
Yes you might have 10 divided by 2	0
Then one is 2537 6 6 goes into 25 four times because 4x6 is 24 13 that would be two times because thats 12 742 4x3	0
Okay	0
No	0
You got it	0
Okay	0
I know	0
But they show you the the same they show you the same information in a different way	0
So all of those are positive slopes okay	0
Its false	0
Then it s smaller and 12 hundredths is 5 tenths	0
We did that	0
Its parallel	0
Do you have to do it with a partner	0
Yes	0
Girls you can pick girl partners	0
All right thank you for most of you paying attention during that	0
Find the fewest number of blocks between other locations on the map	0

So first the students in group A served themselves some of the casserole then the students in group B took some of what was left	0
Okay	0
Youre looking pretty good here	0
Okay thank you	0
But the one thing I want you to think about is youre taking this population of Riverhead town minus all the other populations combined	0
So Yeah itd closest to zero awesome	0
So this one is four fourths and that equals one	0
Uhhuh	0
You want me to hold it down here	0
So if I do my line straight across there is two thirds there is one third	0
Yes	0
Yes	0
Remember your decimal place value chart	0
Another number is three	0
Yes	0
Erase it	0
An integer just means a whole number	0
Im going to skip down to what is 20 of 80	0
You had to figure out in part A that youre using 110	0
Teacher do I have to so far I have as starting number	0
Were going to look at some other answers and I want you to compare yours	0
Lets see if they have they dont have the board	0
Im very excited to come in and spend some time teaching and doing some math with you today	0
I found it	0
Im not talking if you reverse these and you put the 90 here and the five here thats wrong	0
Two thats what I meant to do	0
Dont tell us Judith	0
Maybe try exiting out and reloading Molly got hers to start working	0
All right	0
I think I know	0
You take your Y value your second one subtract it from your first one	0
Student B	0
Oh friends give me five	0
Yes well you have to pick a letter for that	0
I bet you when I show you the answer you will agree that it is super easy	0
Im going to show you what my expectations are for number one	0
So your very first slide has all of these little fingers that remind me a lot of Tetris	0
And Im gonna actually steal a couple of graphs here	0
All good	0
You didnt follow the directions	0
Samuel s confused	0
Everyone close your eyes	0
Thirtytwo is to the fifth power 64 and 128	0
Inches	0
You cant just do that	0
And then D explain how you know your answer is reasonable	0
Mia what can you do	0
not make you do it at recess because I didnt respond to her	0
Now what youre going to do is you are going to have to fill in some new ordered pairs	0
Oh we missed that one	0
Other people feel the same	0
Hold on friends	0
So imagine I squeezed in a three right here	0
And Id like you to write vertex	0
Thank you	0
If you at any point in time were having a conversation with a friend by you outside I need you to raise your hand	0
type them in the chat box	0
Another strategy that I also like to do is multiplying by 10	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
And then I did one plus 2 equals 3	0
Write it in words and write the value of the digit as it would appear in expanded form without writing the whole digit I only want that digit	0
That would be a way to start a sentence	0
Three10ths seven10ths one10th	0
Just imagine you move the pieces all together so theres three still and then you just pick up that one and put it in the spot and then it would still be	0
My answer is the same because we both explain the process used	0
Just questions one and two	0
You should write it down	0
All right	0
Then you can do the same but with fractions	0
I feel like thats why	0
So this would be double the first number	0
Ms Levy I have a question	0
So all these things about multiplication and division I drew a picture for you lots of different ways of figuring out what one fifth of a whole number is	0
All right	0
So its the same thing	0
Two thousand ninety yen	0
Just a little more this is too hard	0
Hey lets bring up one	0
Start at 12 both hands	0
Okay	0
No you said seven	0
Okay	0
Yep	0
Oh okay	0
Yeah curved inside	0
All right	0
Five hundred dollars in the ratio four to six which would have been nice as two to three wouldnt it because we like a simple ratio	0
Okay	0
Okay what I want you to do then as a pair is to open this up  and take a fat marker take either the blue or the red and draw  this for me	0
Im just kidding	0
So here is now what were going to see if we can do	0
Visually youre showing me but youre not showing me your math	0
Youre going to sometimes get the choice to what to count by	0
Okay	0
Red	0
Hes got eyes and he can look	0
So its either greater than or less than or equal to	0
I cant make another basket so Im going to give an orange to this guy an orange to this guy an orange to this guy and an orange to this guy	0
The denominator	0
Now if I were to be making five factor rainbow my outside would be my one times 15	0
And thats how we can go from eight to seven	0
I think I had to have a group of three	0
But lets actually practice it	0
Okay raise your hands so I can send you to your proper desk	0
Yes	0
Yes that is correct	0
Okay so your y intercept you would say negative three or zero comma negative three	0
Because you wont need those for this part	0
Okay	0
Yes so they spent 18000 which again  could be groceries or something totally necessary	0
Onehalf	0
That is part of your mathematical thinking of understanding that prompt and the relevant information that I need	0
Yesterday we were adding and subtracting fractions that had the same denominator so that was pretty easy to do	0
The dot plot is especially helpful in finding the mode and the ordered value bar graph is an effective way to display the mean	0
Yeah I want to look at this one	0
Alexandria youre back up at table because Im not letting you go yet	0
This is what Ive done so far	0
We want to figure out what fraction of a group are left over from this	0
You dont know what Im going to ask	0
Looks good	0
You just use	0
Can you please sit up	0
And if we add 18 we have to add 125	0
You got to find something that works with both of them	0
Oh wait	0
For instance negative 50 to the fiftieth power and plus 50	0
Yeah because it would be three plus three plus three right	0
calculate it like this	0
Very good	0
Its been used twice	0
Youre right	0
It actually we have designed it in a way that it should be able to give you a grade	0
Thank you	0
Then it was representing them in expanded form	0
Eight	0
Mmhmm	0
glad were all communicating well this morning	0
We worked with terms like the value of a numerical expression and the sequence of the mathematical operations	0
You should put that much pressure on yourself when were having these discussions	0
And if you need to expand it out to get the answer like I did thats what Id like you to do	0
Right	0
It means	0
Okay	0
Wasnt it	0
It goes pretty quick but there are two parts	0
Justin stand up	0
All of those	0
Lets take a look at the homework	0
No	0
These are relational symbols	0
Everybody gets some of these	0
We got kind of a long time away from class the past week or so	0
So heres where we need to use those big fourthgrade brains of ours to understand which operation is it that this robot is going to have to do	0
Good	0
Because its an improper fraction	0
So you guys already told me that 624 breaks apart into 600 20 and four	0
Thats cheating	0
And its up three over one up three over one all the way through the graph	0
Im going to start you guys off and say the ratio of and Im going to put them in the order they were given to me so the ratio of soup to cheese to pasta because those are the three things were comparing is	0
I don t know how to start explaining	0
Thats okay	0
Nice job Valarie	0
I know its a little tricky to see	0
Okay	0
So we use this equation one minus equation three	0
He found onefifth of them on a beach in Florida	0
Okay friends if you do not have a ruler and you and your partner are done I would like you to go	0
Maybe Bed Bath  Beyond who knows	0
Now were going to make three batches	0
How many stories did he in the last building he climbed	0
Just check your work to see if you have it correct	0
Okay	0
What	0
That word again	0
When you were doing it I also did it and at the end well look and share	0
Exactly its three out of three	0
So I want to give you guys enough time to actually do your constructed response	0
Which is not really a fun way to spend your lunch	0
That s very interesting thank you for sharing  that	0
Up to enneacontakaihexagon	0
You dont know where the minus could be	0
But there are situations where you cant	0
Try to do it divided by fours	0
I have to convert it to a common denominator	0
Okay thats when you didnt do it the other day	0
You can move your pin	0
94	0
You didnt have to I just wrote it	0
Okay	0
So that means shes buying 48 eggs each month	0
So yesterday Lauren said another good one in the chat	0
Were going to save mine for all our fellow classmates to see how they do	0
And then as a class we are going to see how were feeling	0
And then 180 plus 180 is 360 divided by nine divided by nine and you should get y equals 40	0
Lets go to someone else	0
Everybody stop	0
And Penny make sure I can see your work on these as well	0
And I do like the word end	0
So we did that	0
Just like half of 25 is 12 12	0
Yes	0
Lets say Winnie	0
All right	0
Yes	0
I know	0
Theyve marked off how many steps away they are from the point that theyre trying to find	0
Okay so the first thing we need to do is erase everything	0
So we have two big objectives today	0
Yeah	0
Exactly	0
Okay thank you	0
Okay	0
Yeah they work together more	0
1  2X	0
In your journal today it starts off Actually Im going to have you without talking go take your dry erase board back to your seats and come back and sit down	0
Theres a one here	0
The decimal point would be after the four if I represented it as a whole number	0
Okay Ill give you a little bit of time to show your work	0
You can just do two numbers and get rid of your other one	0
Sorry	0
I have to create a parent account	0
So I kind of think if you go straight from this point to the line its one diagonal	0
Although from looking at what you were writing it seems like stones are plentiful	0
Some of you who have revised your thinking are able to do this	0
Yes	0
So if I have a shape and I want to know what the inside is I want to know how many blocks there are how many boxes there are in the inside of this shape I have to know two things	0
Thanks everybody	0
All right	0
You were gonna say that its two then three then it goes up good guess	0
Im going to turn off the lights so you can see it	0
Big voice	0
Tell me why you think this is my favorite mistake that I saw in the exit tickets	0
If the old guy can do the review you guys can do it	0
And applying rules to ordered pairs	0
Well tell me she is correct	0
Connect	0
Why arent we just using the white board on this	0
If you can also give an explanation that would be amazing	0
This one	0
Draw a picture of this here or in your journal	0
So your job today is to make sure you are responding the way you should be responding using length and width height and width exact ending coordinates and you are rewriting it in a different color	0
And were going to were going to hopefully put all those things together today	0
Follow along	0
You can go and grade these as soon as I hand them back to you tomorrow	0
I multiplied 45 by the same number in the numerator and in the denominator	0
Ok	0
You may check your answer with a calculator	0
Okay	0
All right	0
So you have it once here	0
Were going to talk more about that  when we look at our algorithm you guys are onto something very very cool	0
The A to a three	0
Well kind of	0
Boy you guys got to learn how to add	0
You can have two pieces of paper on your desk	0
Okay	0
Theres A B and C	0
Welcome	0
Nice job	0
No	0
Because five is greater than five times 81 so thats Oh its inequivalent	0
I need it equals one hour	0
All right	0
Im not going to ask you again Missy I will take your chair away if you keep putting your head down	0
be willing to share what they had at first and how you actually revised your thinking	0
Its obviously nothing nothing	0
They said The folder will be taller	0
Thats I dont want you to write five to three is 60	0
Can everybody sit down for a second	0
Okay	0
We cant add them	0
Okay	0
Yes he is but	0
Go ahead hurry up	0
Thats how long your scooter will last	0
Uh huh	0
Hold on	0
Nobody is going to ask you that	0
So Im going to do all of them	0
Right	0
Thats good	0
Five y plus four y is nine y	0
Some of you think we need to make the number line longer	0
So Im not quite sure what their unit is	0
Oh look we  have 3 people 4 people 5 people remembering what we did on  Friday	0
Voices are off	0
So youre just saying that youre gonna yeah	0
Today they added something in there which is the estimate	0
When were estimating	0
Yeah	0
is see how were going to do it twice in a row Ms	0
So we would say similar by side angle side	0
Okay	0
Wait a minute	0
Oh theyre tripling that number	0
And this is four comma one	0
Right	0
Yup	0
Two groups of one and a half	0
We call these equivalent ratios	0
So I think Did you all believe you have the discussions Let me go back to this	0
Lets go into the thousandths place	0
This is the X axis	0
Friends youre supposed to be copying what Im doing	0
divisor	0
So just a refresher	0
Awesome	0
Here good	0
Even though you got the answer right they would mark it wrong because theyre not sure you understand how to divide	0
I might need to unlock the  I would like with Brianna and Sydney can I have Jacob Talia and Mabel and Hudson	0
But to make it look like ABC you kind of and if youre having trouble with the order you can kind of do this	0
Yes	0
Use the grid to help you explain	0
Yes	0
So representations are a visual example of something	0
Its exactly like another homework we had except its got bigger numbers	0
Boards down hands on your lap markers down	0
There you go now shes got it set up so she can do her place values	0
Clays in the bathroom	0
Great job	0
Two times four is eight	0
Because youre only going to buy 10 minus X of the 200yen cakes the cost will be this	0

One windy afternoon Michael rushed over to Selvas tent	0
If youre just saying nine tenths hey Quinn nine tenths thats the answer write it down	0
Again thats a repeat right there right so thats every	0
Theyre	0
Oh Im sorry we were talking arrays	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
So an algorithm is my sweater is advancing the slide so thats an interesting move	0
Please those of you that have not turned in the assignment yet hang on to it	0
Go ahead and finish up your thoughts	0
Tell me what they did incorrectly here	0
Madly and show me your notes Helena please	0
I want us to figure out what that is	0
Okay	0
It depends how you mark it for yourself	0
Whatever you do on the right side you do it on the left side	0
Okay	0
Highlight the important information	0
Otherwise at some point when you  get the denominator	0
And then show them on the overhead	0
And then when it says total number of children thats like adding up all of the separate things not just counting the dots like adding up how many children each persons have had	0
It looks like a six but its 10	0
If I wanted one 10th less I need to take away a zero	0
I think you would add	0
And with only 10 yen you cant buy anything so its this	0
Look at all these hands	0
Nice	0
So now lets go down to our next one	0
Alright couple of quick word problems if you can get the function from them	0
For my class weve always talked about marbles and bags	0
105	0
Theres one more question down here	0
Hm Very good	0
My friends	0
Ah its true	0
Haley do you need to wave just to get it out of your system	0
I m not sure	0
Everybody in this room better know that answer	0
Why dont we try with a partner and then we can learn from that	0
Those are our notes for today	0
On top of the yellow bookcase you may grab a piece of paper	0
All right yellow group has done it orange group and green group	0
We have some angles up here and I want you to talk about angle A and B and it says Suma looked at the two angles	0
So thats another way to think about comparing fractions	0
Now I want you to look at this one this goes into the 1000ths	0
Lets do the check	0
I want you guys to draw a diagram for Terrance please	0
And then Im going to have you share with a partner what it is that you see	0
So what I need you to get out is a colored pencil	0
Okay	0
Lids on	0
Okay so half of eight	0

Stand here	0
Umm that one	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Umm	0
Right	0
So Estella you were the next stick that I pulled	0

Right	0
Im very concerned	0
Yeah no youre going to finish because we did pasta first and youre going to finish it with tuna	0
How many	0
Yeah	0
Excellent job	0
He holds it like this sometimes like this and he writes like If you see him switch to that you can remind him	0
So like its tough to tell exactly where its supposed to be	0
Whats three plus four	0
Okay	0
This should start at zero and end at five	0
And then if I add that and all Im doing is adding straight across there	0
Draw the box Missy	0
Wrong	0
One problem is enough	0
For right now the answer is yes because were just learning	0
So here its day 14 or day 11 and like Franclin said the estimate would be maybe 80	0
Okay so Stacey Reuban and I cant see anybody elses	0
SMART Board so that it works	0
No	0
Thats an air high five big girl	0
Five	0
Thats fine	0
You  have to look in the grade book and not the actual test	0
Okay	0
Number off really quickly one through four or one through five	0
Right so its like this and then all these	0
Ten Es	0
When we multiply five times 8687 were going to have a product that is less than five	0
So well try it without a calculator what would it be	0
What if its 1x plus 1	0
Give me the marker	0
One and two go pick a partner	0
Yes	0
Youre going to do 472 minus 384	0
Okay so I just talked about the ones that were not opened though	0
Im not sure if you add another	0
Maybe we should move on to the next  question	0
So if I am rounding to the nearest 10th I look at the 10th 10th spot	0
Its okay if you had extra step	0
Because I want to see the diagram	0
Thats okay	0
Ms Aldridge I will be right with you	0
All right	0
Christian is that a 13 or a 12	0
Uh okay okay let s try this	0
What they have written up here and what Paul was talking about	0

Right	0
Look at that I dont want that yellow one moving freely about	0
I think Im losing my mind worrying about this online learning stuff	0
Okay looking pretty good	0
Carlotta is arguing that its going to be the same shape	0
Interpolate Collin	0
Just think about the question I just asked you	0
good job	0
Dont get your note capture out yet	0
Blaze Mallory Dane Forest lets finish off today strong	0
So do you mind if I erase this	0
Yeah	0
You all know thats not correct	0
So this is not a function by the way	0
Here you go	0
The chart that you see	0
So the original one was eight one	0
All right	0
If the two sides and another triangle and the included angle on the circle that as well in both are congruent	0
inaudible Im gonna do Number two	0
So you have to account for that	0
Okay Finn come on up	0
Multiplication	0
Yesterday I  was working with a group of thirty teachers  thats why I  couldnt be here  um Mr Purdy was there in the afternoon  he was here in the morning and I was showing them some of  your work and werent they impressed	0
So four yerts will hold 24 not quite the 27 that we needed but pretty close	0
So  have a look here	0
God  I love that Im seeing some people writing out all the steps	0
By fives okay we did fives	0
The average amount of precipitation in Death Valley California in January is 39100 of an inch	0
There are two possible answers	0
Good	0
Well skip number nine for now	0
Okay	0
Okay thank you	0
Okay	0
Crew Im looking at your work thank you for following along and checking your answers while we were doing that	0
Yep	0
Okay	0
And then were gonna do some questions that are a little bit new	0

Okay	0
My friends who are doing the challenge and Mrs  so Owen here 1s a paper Ive printed about scientific notation at the printer would you please grab that	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
So lets use that same number line that you guys have given that number and lets go back to that	0
Okay so rise and run you can graph them and figure it out	0
This is not congruent	0
Double the first coordinate of all the points	0
Look at Number 3 Number 4 Number 5 Number 6	0
Length	0
Come up here Paul take your work with you	0
And then if this one is 70 This ones going to be 70 as well	0
No Landon is not with Nate	0
Okay	0
So it says um multiple times in the paragraph that Dakota read for us that on average or the following average amounts of food in one year	0
And you do that	0
That is also correct	0
That ones fine	0
Write an equation for that	0
We revise our writing	0
Then as Michael just pointed out I get to hear and Id realize wait a minute I cant do that	0
It doesnt matter because itll change both signs	0
Nine 10 11 12 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24	0

Its the hours	0
Okay	0
So actually I really like your picture	0
Okay	0
All right and then theyre in debt but  then they make a certain amount of money or somehow deposit a certain amount of money	0
Now I was looking through and I saw that a lot of us did well but we can still do better	0
Kind of in the middle right there	0
One like that	0
I think for the vast mJakeority of you for todays lesson the picture method is going to be it	0
Wait do we have Could we coverup others sticky notes	0
Do you under  and its Oh you had the  fraction	0
Okay	0
Lets look at this one	0
I like that you have this	0
On your marks get set	0
I dont know	0
No talking right now though because were trying to collect some information	0
Yes	0
Why is it here	0
3000	0
Hi Leanna	0
All right everybody we got about five more seconds until 229	0
Oh no worries Daphne	0
Everyone should be showing Adelle respect and our full attention	0
Were going to start with the tens	0
Okay	0
But until youre there youll utilize the multiplication table	0
Next one	0
Freeze	0
Okay	0
You get 30 degrees	0
Yes	0
Negative seven	0
Four divided by negative two is negative two	0
Okay	0
My first question for you today says a sticker costs 75 cents	0
We do 32 by five	0
Any questions so far	0
Think time	0
Listen up there are times when making an estimate is not helpful or practical so you guys now know how to do this kind of problem but if I gave you this problem 0073 times 002	0
This isnt going to fit on notebook paper	0
Put an X there	0
I hate pita bread	0
That didnt tell me you were almost done	0
In the graph you will see how the amount of water goes down in the boiler during showering	0
Read your problem	0
If you play basketball you have to know how to read and understand those plays	0
This is a nice point right here it goes right through the corners of the boxes	0
I was on this inscribed angle and getting the triangle sum theorem	0
Perfect	0
Youre going to need a little bit of information today to solve a couple problems	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
If youve already estimated that way you are good	0
Lets try that one	0
Yes	0
Three two one and show	0
There were a couple of questions that are in there	0
No	0
Okay	0
Now were back on track	0
Be quiet or Ill just forget about the whole thing	0
Then I want you to think about what pattern is happening here	0
So 204 shares equals 408 dollars one share is two dollars 200 shares would be 400 two times 200	0
You put the center point of a protractor on the dot	0
Im going to do exactly what is in your note catcher	0
So because these are still multiplication weve just switched the order we can still say 6	0
Collin made	0
Okay so now let s try let s try to do something that will be illegal but make a true statement	0
So I have a five by eight	0
I had it as a fraction three and foursevenths	0
Its a half sheet	0
Five four three two one	0
Remember friends when you are done raise your hand so I can come around and look	0
Okay	0
Theres one thing I want to clarify with you before you move forward	0
So just be aware of that as well	0
So theres 12 of them	0
You have to show a diagram and a fraction addition equation	0
Letter B	0
That is what I imagined you did	0
Were going to talk about that on the graphing hats paper that you have	0
which because its Friday you dont have homework	0
Awesome	0
OK so I d like you to rewrite your triangle if you like	0
So this one will keep going on and on and on forever just like the other one except this one is now 33 instead of 66	0
You can make one pizza here wait	0
Eyes up here this is really important	0
You do have a shoulder partner	0
Youre going to Wild World or whatever its called	0

What do you do when you and your partner are finished	0
You have this	0
Eight minutes	0
Show me with your body that youre ready	0
Youre only putting it in the document	0
And this time not only am I not going to teach it Im not going to be at the front of the board writing it	0
Okay that would be 25	0
You are going to turn to page 134	0
So we have to do the exact opposite	0
Its less than okay	0
Nope	0
Ive never seen that W horns	0
I would like everyone to try number one	0
Okay thanks for checking my work	0
Lets move forward	0
Okay	0
Okay so lets then do factors of eight	0
Yes	0
You do not need anything out except for your yellow and	0
So go ahead and hop on Forest in your Google Classroom today	0
Now let me ask you this says 40100 but what Martin gave us is 410	0
It is a function	0
Oh wait a minute	0
Okay	0
Show	0
Lets go through	0
I m very confused	0
So youll have two up here and one down here youll add them together and then youll get the largest quotient	0
It can really be any common multiple but itll make your life easier if you find the least common multiple	0
Well go to six	0
Go ahead	0
You used a big word escalate	0
By the end of today you need to be able to find a typical value using mean	0
Were gonna work through this	0
Last I checked when I hold up three fingers you should have nothing in your hands	0
Then I see the word perimeter up there	0
Okay	0
Sit down Kathleen	0
Yes	0
Okay so alternate interior angles	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
I wasnt here	0
A lot of more sense	0
Some of us will  be around to kind of hear what youre thinking  about it	0
I will know I am successful when I write a number problem that involves multiplying a fraction and a whole number in realworld context	0
So its going to get 10 times bigger so were moving it to the right	0
We re trying to word it because we know we know what it  is	0
Lilith is four years older than Damien	0
Not all of them but a couple of examples	0
So so far we have 55 and 15	0
This is what weve been doing all week	0
Maybe youve seen negative numbers before	0
Or you may choose somebody else s solution that you don t  agree with that you find something wrong with it that you write about that	0
So we have the theorems of equivalence that we saw	0
Justify my thinking	0
Okay	0
Yes because otherwise I cant calculate it too well	0
Which we have spoken about the word efficient for	0
were going to get to that today talking about congruency and things	0
multiply it but I think its	0
We interpret stuff	0
To the left of zero	0
Who will clean up the blackboard	0
Right away this is not a straight line	0
The minus to take away the minus And then the quarter to take away the four	0
Okay	0
Therefore I know the farmer put five carrots on the partially filled tray	0
Okay my friends can I get everybody to go to a zero please	0
It is also the side of the triangle	0
Ill give you a free pass today on that but in the future if you dont have your work then no stamp	0
Write  three fractions that are equivalent to one	0
Where am I going	0
Dont worry	0
Youre welcome	0
The three X you left alone	0
Instead of partial products answers in multiplication problem now were going to have partial quotients answers in division problems	0
So if I add four to both sides Im not going to show that to you for time sake I have five p equals 15	0
This one says eight times I lost my gun	0
Nice	0
Five four	0
Hmm not a lot	0
Okay	0
No	0
I want to show you something that we might start talking about tomorrow	0
Ivan is 3000 years old	0
Im going to show you an image made up of dots but only for three seconds you need to find out how many dots there are and be prepared to explain how you saw them	0
Someone from table five	0
Just about 30 more seconds	0
And cant remember	0
Okay	0
And Ill highlight that in the color in a second	0
Well theres two different sides here	0
Then for some of them were going to use tables	0
Should I get the stamps over here yet	0
Holy cow look at the hands	0
Im going to cry	0
She does not want it to be taller	0
They already both have the	0
So were going to use something similar to a number line	0
This will equal	0
Now the way to think about this guys is simply Isaiah Im really not liking how much youre talking about things that have nothing to do with our math lesson today	0
Its only following you	0
And you  were trying to say maybe that could get you to  some general point	0
Okay	0
What	0
Thats half of that	0
You are very welcome to discuss the matter in pairs	0
Well cheer for you	0
But I was trying to say that	0
Okay	0
All right we got five people	0
Yes	0
The square of a larger perimeter and hexagon of a smaller perimeter	0
12	0
Okay	0
I got to look back at my notes	0
I want you to use your shoulder partners	0
Thank you Georgia for your willingness to go take care of that	0
Sit back down	0
Okay	0
So then we can take 9 and divide it by 3 into these three other sections	0
Ha yeah	0
So lets talk about what we learned this semester	0
Keep that pattern going	0
All right	0
Youve got to scoot your desk forward	0
You have hundredths written	0
Erase it	0
Some	0
That will get you there as well	0
Oh that was hard	0
A lot of these are basic computations if you know how to multiply two by one digit and subtract and add thats really what were doing today using this chart with money and time	0
This is the data she gathered	0
Yeah	0
All right highfive	0
Yes	0
How are you doing Kyra	0
Five four so three four	0
Okay we stop here	0
And so they neShane some data from other students	0
Christoph partner or me	0
And I cant help you if youre not paying attention	0
Oh my gosh	0
because thats 8 1 9 4x4 is 16 and thats a remainder three	0
Its A to the fourth and B to the fourth	0
Okay	0
Do all of your lines so that theyre vertical	0
400 times six	0
Then when you add another place to it	0
I checked it	0
Well you repeat the question ne more time because Zach was talking and he said it	0
Well it surprises well	0
I know youre doing this earlier on TTM and I got most of your  correct	0
Okay okay	0
If it Polygon is just a name for any number of sides	0
Perfect	0
We need to make sure to know what we are comparing	0
Okay well Im trying to find my	0
This is how many parts were going to be breaking our dividend which is the 263 into in order to get our final quotient	0
I have mentioned it before	0
Okay its got opposite sides are congruent	0
Okay	0
Awesome	0
All right	0
So youre basically saying you want to take whatever n is minus 900	0
There are one two three four five six	0
One no	0
Were going to start at 0	0
Oh Im sorry Matt show me your other page then	0
Do you want to 81 in the Okay divided by five	0
You see that every time you go up by one for x you go down by 05 for y or down by a half those are the same thing one half and down by 05	0
Weve looked at slope	0
It was the answer key	0
So heres what the definition of segment bisector is	0
right	0
Okay	0
Ill have to Ill tell you after class	0
And I someone wrote it goes up by one each time	0
All right	0
Okay	0
Multiplicative identity property	0
179	0
They re just smaller than one but you re still multiplying	0
Imagine what the answer would look like	0
That same one	0
So there is a first question	0
Okay so find f of four	0
Okay	0
Fine	0
And you all explained we explained how to do this using partial quotients and regular us traditional long division	0
Okay	0
91000 is less than 1100	0
I want Mary	0
So right now see if you can do it	0
Describe what you think will	0
We are now going to go into the math message	0
That s your secret	0
Y equals zero	0
As a matter of fact right after break were going to have a meeting	0
We want to go up top	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Youve got 30 seconds	0
All right what if I did	0
Okay	0
You have to know what 4 times 7 is 28 to then attach the two zeros	0
Its right here	0
If theyre way off then that means you measured wrong but if theyre like pretty close like if youre within point one or point two for each of them like probably measured pretty accurately	0
Were going to go back to the fractions when were done	0
Theyre watching me	0
Once again crew make sure you are annotating your ratio tables	0
Okay	0
Okay so lets try another one	0
Those are like cups and teaspoons that we would measure with	0
400 to 40 and just divide by 10	0
Oh	0
Take advantage of this time and work with a partner and write the best constructed response that you can	0
The information Im going to add is already in your note catcher but I just want your full attention	0
So you are thinking correctly youre already thinking vertically	0
Im watching this piece of metal	0
Okay thank you	0
Why is it named after Ludolf	0
This time this time we just simplified these two parts	0
Yeah	0
So lets use our trigonometry	0
I want to see you guys writing that down in your note catcher please	0
Yep all	0
Youre estimating number four	0
youre forgetting to add the person theyre talking about	0
Yes	0
You  think you made another you made a different model	0
Three	0
Yes we looked at that	0
If Sarah uses her rule what do you think the new trapezoid will look like	0
Okay	0
Brian show me number two	0
Lets try another one	0
I want it explained	0
Is this problem like one Ive solved before	0
All right were going to start off with the dog	0
Pick one pick one like lets say green	0
We did 20 x 30 and four and then we got 680	0
Because were missing the smallest	0
If I put those together I get four	0
Uhhuh	0
So a lot of this is the model that being able to explain which fractions are bigger and why	0
So when youre writing your equation for a vertical line you just think about whats the same about all the points theyre always x equals two	0
Okay	0
So we have seven pieces that are the size of a sixth	0
Lets pick one	0
Lets do one more round	0
Maybe write it  in words here	0
However as this is melting let s switch candy bars	0
Nicely done Aliza	0
When youre trying to figure out all the problems	0
Um the computer that wasnt working yesterday has decided its much happier about working today so they all are working	0
Oh please repeat the steps for if youre on an iPhone	0
But this is super super super important	0
What is that	0
Write all the numbers	0
Yeah were  changing the number names for the rods	0
So here is what Im going to do	0
Excuse me mind if I play through	0
Were jumping right into unit five	0
Okay	0
Maybe Ill say were going to do page 140	0
Right	0
Fifth graders use rulers	0
So well have two and some number of 40ths plus 10 and some number of 40ths	0
You write again the object when youve taken away the brackets	0
Uh uh	0
which is two meters long	0
Because youre comparing parts of things	0
Quickly and get back and get this done	0
Thats true ok thats true	0
Now this is the last one were going to do together before we get to our journal activity	0
Negative X	0
OK AmyLynn	0
That gives 12 equals 2x divided by two divided by two I get x equals six for that	0
I can t hear you	0
So lets draw in the diagonals here and see what happens	0
A story up about it	0
Okay they owe the bank 5000 which really means its negative 5000	0
Yeah both pages both pages	0
12 divided by two is six and then 312 is a little tricky to do	0
Well go really fast through these	0
So these last two examples are going to give us those rules for the last couple blanks	0
Okay	0
Are these homeworks youre working on	0
Namely three by three or you can just count the squares that gives us nine	0
Okay	0
First both authors convey the importance of having safe drinking water	0
Okay and then lets just make sure were clear on on y intercept as well	0
Im going to use this	0
Okay	0
So the square root of 25 is so its five two squared is four five minus four is one	0
Give me a break and keep working please	0
Raise your hand if you are partner A	0
And everybody agreed okay	0
Kind of	0
We look at A we did it together as an example	0
arent here the obliq oblique lines here and	0
Yes	0
Yeah	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
Alright so same kind of deal as yesterday	0
That you have to make into a square root	0
Lets see what did we do	0
I love that you guys were that was really good discussion	0
I mean youre not	0
Nice job	0
Im disagreeing now	0
Stop for a second	0
Youre mumbling	0
Youre writing this down in your notes right now please	0
Okay packet to page 17 please	0
Im gonna put measure of angle one right here	0
Yes	0
Right	0
Come on	0
Well thanks for asking you feeling better today	0
Turn to page 31	0
Okay good	0
I go horizontal first	0
Okay so parts and you said parts of a whole	0
And then six is 12	0
Okay	0
Okay so were going to do a rainbow	0
One goes to five four goes to four and six	0
And then we will also talk about it tomorrow as well	0
Okay Im going to try to get these filled out	0
Come join the group because thats going to help you find	0
Thats fine	0
Adam	0
45	0
I cant use the 10 Harley because thats for 10 boxes	0
That was good	0
It wants you to make an estimate make a guess about how many do you think	0
Like these here right different size  candy bars	0
Yes art	0
Ichiro	0
Now take six of the ones	0
Theres the picture of his original	0
Because of the	0
Okay don t say it	0
And we already know that the domains cant have more than one arrow to be a function	0
So youll have all five classes and my offer or bonus is that those of you that want Im willing to help you at the sixth hour	0
So if you have a triangle with with the same three sides and then you make another triangle with those same three sides no matter what its going to make the same exact triangle	0
Even your writing needs to be in the different color	0
A full sheet of paper	0
So you subtract that from 180 and that gives you what the other angle is	0
Youre just multiplying	0
But theres a reason	0
Im pretty sure every single person in this whole room got this one right	0
Okay	0
It s your choice not one but two or three or four or five	0
I might have you do it this way	0
Its gotta come out to 24ths	0
Uh uh	0
He ate threefourths times onesixth	0
Thirds this way	0
Okay	0
Very good Michael	0
Let me out too real quick sorry Frank	0
We did 15 instead of 35	0
1 2 3	0
Now talk about there other one	0
Ankur has another way of thinking about Matt s idea	0
Let me see your partnerships	0
Nice job	0
Its probably	0
Poor Dolly	0
So go to the screen	0
Hey tell me what you need help with	0
MMhmm	0
Okay so heres what were gonna do	0
I have a question	0
So now my loves we are going to multiply 03 times seven	0
Thats it	0
They are	0
Youre staying in one right now	0
Go	0
Now what if I did this	0
SS right five three two one	0
Let me show you Queen Arlenes dilemma here	0
Everybody	0
Okay	0
So in two years there are about 100 weeks	0
If I have a problem for example zero A to the fifth power is that zero	0
You agree that youre going to participate in the Pear Deck with me when we do that	0
Whoops	0
This is super important	0
15 is open were going to close 18 is closed and were going to open it	0
Im going to give you guys two minutes to solve that problem and then well come back together	0
Yes	0
Now I can do this the exact same way	0
Yes you get a common denominator then you add the numerator and you get an improper fraction	0
So Im going to ask you ask you 10 quick questions on that	0
Make sure that you have written the word pizzas so that you know what your number actually represents what question its actually asking	0
Yes	0
He was going to America	0
There you go	0
Per trick	0
See what you can do	0
You are going to do number two	0
And you keep on putting them in	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
The starting number is four	0
Here is your pen okay and this is Theres this left this left and this left right and then his brother wants 14 of that okay so he wants 14 of what is left	0
My divisor can either tell us how many marbles there are per group or how many groups it is	0
Hypotenuse	0
One two and three	0
Equals H Okay	0
All right people so surf times	0
Yes think about ways in which these are the same	0
Okay so your assignment for today is page 93	0
Oh yeah I dont understand it	0
Barbara can you pass these out	0
No	0
Does anybody remember what that fancy phrase was for	0
All right so I have three cans of food	0
And Ill show you that slide in just a moment	0
I know Im going 30	0
your range 12345 least to greatest no repeats	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
We need to highlight 19 violin students	0
She was four years older Noah because	0
Oh thats okay	0
Okay nice job	0
We got two and 189 thousandths	0
So if our question is how much oil should you use it looks like our answer is 16	0
This is to motivate you to try to get good at it	0
Youre good right up till the very end	0
Yeah	0
The left side is bigger than the right one Jitka	0
One of the numbers is two	0
210 is in blue over here	0
Or whats your favorite flavor of koolaid	0
Thank you	0
For example the US flag represents the United States	0
I will read from the book and you are supposed to be at the same place page 40 number four at the swimming pool meaning	0
You make a triangle somewhere	0
Theyre going to cross somewhere over here so theyre not parallel because they have different slopes	0
Yeah okay	0
So Im just looking at the tenths place	0
Although I would probably say x equals three for yours	0
Thats this number	0
Think about what I just talked to you about about a basic fact and an extended fact	0
Thats okay Ill give you a piece of paper	0
Sorry I didnt look at that	0
Good job so many people in the chat	0
Looking at my table then when I go over 10 I should go up to 300	0
You can do it	0
The second one	0
someone else while I find it	0
Jeffery come write it	0
Easier if you divide by seven first	0
Red	0
And I know it takes a while to color so you can just kind of shade it in really quickly	0
Going from feet to inches heres a fill in the missing boxes	0
Does anyone know	0
So Im going to mash those two together	0
This means two things that you can find a fraction	0
Yeah	0
Number 10	0
All right	0
We are going to be talking about how to measure factions in a number line	0
Lets think about this	0
So its going to be less than three fours	0
Hold it until I tell you to show me	0
Thats okay	0
Thats what were going to be focusing on	0
Yes I thought it sounded logical actually	0
The one that has sentence eight in it it says The ratio of cups of tomato sauce to tablespoons of oil is 1 to 3	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Youve also put it at the end over here	0
The idea behind this game is that you are going to quiz your partner so that is one quiz	0
You got it girl	0
I just want you to get another six	0
She eats two thirds of the part of the veggie pizza she has	0
Wait will the sailboat look the same	0
You understand the concept	0
And theres an ending point to some things and we will be addressing that in just a minute	0
So we put that in words it would look like this AB segment	0
So were going to do it for one and three tenths four and nine tenths and 13 and seven tenths	0
Go for it my friends	0
Okay	0
Then for my second one I got 60 times two	0
Mmhmm	0
For 5 And six I just want to give you two small hints for this	0
This is going to be super fun	0
So can really this like I so um this is a way to double check my work later on	0
You are going to do some sharing so dont erase	0
What Im saying is I cant see anything after you got zero though	0
I would like you to drag the icon where you believe you sit right now	0
Perfect	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
I have a question	0
One	0
I would like you to zip up your backpacks and place it under your desks	0
I know	0
What I need you to do is log out	0
So lets check the tenths place	0
One three	0
Okay so this time were going to work with bottles of water	0
If everythings the same about them then the triangles are the same	0
Organize it so it can be followed by others	0
Its this red guy right here	0
Oh your your monitor try	0
Sorry Carson I forgot to turn this on	0
Youre gonna need your math journals	0
Once at least two people at your table have one you can share	0
A whole	0
One two three four five	0
Where do you get the N from	0
Explain how you do those	0
yesterday	0
Were going to figure out when Lilith is eight how old was Damien	0
I think we need to use this traditional method	0
Okay	0
Thirtytwo divided by four	0
This is the total of all of them combined	0
Yes	0
The quantity A B cubed	0
I am going to randomly call on somebody I want you to tell me if you got it correct or incorrect	0
Not here	0
now youve got two of them	0
You never use them	0
Same point	0
So always write that the perimeter is Pi times D yes	0
So those are the problems youre  working on I just want to be sure you know all know the  problems youre working on now	0
Okay okay	0
Well go over the first probably row or two and then were gonna talk about the general pattern at the end with X	0
Okay	0
Now subtract	0
Six is just mean	0
I hear that	0
This isnt a trick question	0
One two three Actually can I borrow your marker	0
Its not like twos and 10s	0
So that tells you that started many years ago	0
Its all over the place	0
We can	0
And then well share	0
And so the answer is going to be greater than this time	0
I love that I have pride Sam but I thought there was only one in the class more	0
Because we used a lot of paper yesterday	0
Lets go	0
You could load up your card again with some more points and then keep going on	0
Oh and talk about it if you guys dont agree	0
Okay so y equals negative 2x plus 10	0
Shared screen everybody	0
Ill go down	0
Ms Strathom Im not done	0
So in a few words with the straw inserted like this in reality it isnt of any use that the box is high it could also be a box thats very flat	0
Good job	0
Because its really important	0
I have six	0
Thank you	0
Ah	0
Let me close these rooms	0
One word	0
Okay	0
All right	0
Couple things I want to point out today that are going to be really important as we kind of work through some other problems for today	0
Just wait	0
Okay	0
Because he took a short cut	0
The amount of money depends on how far the walk the distance	0
Which is why it is less than	0
And then you could pass those out	0
So I round it down	0
Yeah	0
The xaxis is here	0
But if it clarifies things for yourself then you may of course	0
So were going to just go right across 123456	0
Missy why dont you join me at the front table	0
Thank you	0
You all have this but Im going to give you an extra one	0
Okay	0
Do I have a friend and Ashley I want you to show me the neighbor and compare your thinking to your neighbors and see if you got the same thing	0
It is rote memory	0
Equals to approximately just write it in	0
But for identity you have in fact infinite many solutions	0
Negative four	0
I will say that the homework today is pretRayne quick and I think its very doable	0
It is the last problem in uh the section so we should really take a look at that one	0
Yeah he didnt	0
That one was easy	0
Oh I got it	0
Minus five X or minus two X	0
Below is the picture of the original trapezoid she drew on a coordinate grid	0
You will have to answer this question	0
Okay	0
I dont want mark	0
And sometimes crew when you have numbers that youre not sure what the least common multiple is you can use a division ladder	0
Table group one please go look at the data up there	0
you finished try a harder multiplication problem that we were trying to	0
Now you know how to label that	0
That means you have to tell them what theyre looking at	0
I know but we have to transition to our next station	0
Hold your paper up until everyone is done	0
What you should have done is you should have done this times two because thats the opposite of divide by two which cancels it out	0
Notice whats happening in the coordinate rules	0
Your job today is to complete on a piece of paper just a second	0
Pam pam	0
Okay so now my guys are like Angelas	0
Nice job friends	0
Its okay if its a Japanese radish	0
Five four three two one zero	0
What if I give you a new Im going to show you a new strategy and then Im going to give you a problem and you can decide if you want to use the multiple skipcounting strategy or the new strategy	0
Make a drawing for your sentence showing it	0
Ill have rulers out over there because I would like you as fifth graders to make sure that youre drawing straight lines to connect points	0
Yes	0
There are two extra	0
Your turn	0
Hadley please make two double digit numbers on your side	0
Very good	0
3650 five minus zero five	0
For midpoint were going to be refreshing our memory on what a midpoint is and what the formula for a midpoint is	0
Probably if you used another one  another two you could fill in that with more  purples and using more reds too	0
Are we writing it down	0
It should be 21	0
We had said the one rightangled side squared plus the other rightangled side squared	0
What did they get on the final exam	0
I can divide it into thirds but I cant divide it into fourths	0
Well catch up on Monday	0
So you will be drawing three triangles or two	0
Theyre advertising two for 3 or 3 for 11 I think theyre trying to get you to buy more	0
I just want you to look at your answers	0
Okay	0
I need you working at tables	0
Yes definitely	0
Now I see five	0
So well do 15 this is what we did yesterday	0
Now I need to do 100ths times seven hundredths	0
They can be used for multiplication and addition	0
Beautiful	0
Lets go back to the first thing here	0
I Im doing the the measurements	0
Okay were starting	0
Right	0
This is the Yaxis and the Xaxis time and distance	0
Whitney and Raul thanks for your help today	0
Thank you Jericho	0
So would it just be that and the	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
We know how to do that	0
Red	0
Remember yesterday I was freezing all day	0
Headphones marbles if you have those	0
Multiplication division and then addition and subtraction	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Alright were missing one	0
Oh no	0
Make your table set it up  five minutes 5 10 15 20	0
Thats easy difficulty here x plus x minus 26	0
You cant just change the problem	0
Asher Laura	0
So the quicker you get done with this the quicker I have other things for you to move on to	0
Well the same thing Id always  something is I put it vertically up and down because I cant multiply when its side to side	0
Draw a figure like this and	0
And that is five so we will not be doing that	0
So I know both things	0
Julia you are absolutely right	0
Right	0
Yes	0
Theres 13 marbles left in our big bucket	0
Whats special about improper fractions is that they are always more than one	0
Hudson get away from Marco and stop	0
Still only one way but when we get up here it gets a little trickier	0
Two bright students	0
Very good	0
Yeah	0
Could be all kinds of things	0
Okay	0
I know I just did one	0
There is our answer	0
Instead of tablespoons these are teaspoons	0
Because then I have  another question a challenge for both of you	0
asked me to do was draw a five by eight rectangle	0
Or how did we call it yesterday there our our friend and helper	0
were just gonna list out all the ways that these are similar	0
Lets just yes or no	0
Some of you might not need to use the grids to add but I would like you just for a couple of them you could do the addition first and then I want you to prove your answer with the grid	0
And count how many pieces there are	0
All right good job	0
Minus one	0
There	0
So based off of these first couple rows were saying that this person spends 5 every week	0
When youve got an estimate stand	0
So Id like you to graph the five points	0
Okay	0
Im gonna let your look at this one first	0
Okay	0
If I have 12 I dont have a whole	0
Theres one fifth two fifth three fifth four fifth five fifth six fifth seven fifth	0
There are learning  for today	0
So ladies and gentlemen we go over to our in and out box and we put an eight	0
The heater is still on	0
Youre going to take one of those	0
Uh lets see	0
You said that your divisor is always your first number in your thinking box	0
Well all do it together	0
We could say 15 times 39 or we could arrange those cards to make other numbers	0
Okay then please look in the direction of the blackboard	0
I wonder if I need to use this at all	0
Your table should be 140 280 3120	0
Okay	0
Sorry	0
You must take the compass and do the same thing in the book as I did at the blackboard	0
Students therefore think of the rule times 15 as times one divided by five	0
That gives me 28 is equal to four a I divide both sides by four	0
Do 106 because it is the first out of subtraction and addition	0
Not what I want	0
And then S goes to here	0
I think it got stuck	0
So lets take 2000 and were going to divide it by four	0
So lets read	0
Okay	0
Im going to give you about a minute or two on your own to do a little revising and thinking	0
Yes	0
R is 30  in this problem	0
Okay	0
Write this out	0
And see if you can make me  if it works for  other models because some students don t believe that it works for  other models and I think you two believe that it works for other  models	0
Okay I will teach you in a bit	0
And that would be an equivalent ratio	0
But if Im no longer multiplying anything in the ones value its tens	0
Okay	0
12 minus 13	0
They dont create a problem they are already on the left	0
I can add and subtract fractions and mixed numbers with like denominators to solve number stories heres how youre successful	0
Elijah thank you	0
It should be an inch and a quarter or a half or something to the nearest 14 inch	0
So if my standard form is 326 and Im writing it in expanded form Im doing 300 plus 20 plus six	0
There they are	0
Taking this quadrilateral without changing the area make it into a triangle	0
You work by yourself and then you check with a partner	0
And so it keeps track of what kind of conversations that we have	0
The blue represents one cup of water	0
Other homework tonight	0
Hello	0
We are going to start with your I can start with this	0
Plus 45	0
Done and it is closed	0
Yes	0
break those into thirds for me	0
SS right five four three two one zero	0
It would be good job	0
She did thirty times twenty is six hundred seven times twenty is a hundred and forty	0
I went back and I retaught the material and tested theSSagain	0
First were finding 23 of 9	0
Youre good Ben	0
Twothirds times twothirds	0
We appreciate you sharing because thats how we learn in math	0
Yeah	0
Good day everyone	0
The answer	0
Okay thats fine thank you Just use your process keep your process	0
Im going to add 0009 if you cant see Clay if youre not looking youre not going to get this	0
This does not mean youre eliminating these numbers it just means youre done with those numbers	0
Okay	0
You hear that referred to as the origin a lot thats where everything starts	0
So I think it helped out for me	0
Uh several people are still on assignment three four or five	0
So in the previous example they both worked	0
But Im also acknowledging the fact that I know what I want	0
So go back and fix that	0
Thank you for those of you who dared to disagree	0
Oh I like that game	0
Heres the process youre going to take though	0
So a ratio table can be a quick way to convert a fraction to a decimal	0
Yeah	0
Yes exactly	0
You did but this is what this is not what you saved	0
Extrapolate	0
I think that I agree with Alan and Andrew because they are right you cant see the thing but  if you put it under a    244  Mark microscope and if it is a really powerful one you would have a huge space there	0
Is the elliptical device thing	0
Georgia you shook your head so Im going to come right to you	0
Both from 400 to 40 you can use other columns	0
It does	0
One last word because tomorrow you have your test over this unit and this is the last word that might show up on the test that you need to know	0
You two would be partners	0
Okay	0
Heres what you may do	0
Do you have a whiteboard	0
Very similar	0
So one person say Laura here will read out her instructions and the other two will actually follow her instructions all right	0
Addition of fraction	0
All right I would like you to solve problems one two and a half of journal page 163	0
Its going to be equal to	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
So you get the theorem	0
Pairs compare	0
Yes	0
We have so many friends here	0
Yes	0
What do you mean were learning this	0

Alright Rene Im going to give you a problem Rene	0
Im trying to see it looks like Zoes icon a little bit except its has a little more purple to it	0
Maybe shes not  the same	0
When your initial two numbers give you a zero you can not count that as part of your zeros	0
Were going to have a discussion about our answers and kind of what we came up with	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
I would love to hear your connection after you write this	0
We could just take that out and the six can be right next to the N	0
Four	0
And then check this out	0
Brady who is your partner	0
Hold on	0
So were going to go on to the next one	0
No	0
OK you may want to think about that some more but that s a very clever idea	0
Yeah	0
Then I have a question for you	0
Ok I hold this	0
Yes very good	0
All right	0
Okay	0
Onethird is the exact same amount as threeninths	0
I got 14x  30 and then I divide it by 14	0
CAE is 29	0
Easy	0
You can excuse by Nadia	0
So today we are going to do 34	0
So that one	0
Im not allowed to jump	0
We have 207 people on this trip and we need 35 chaperones correct	0
I cant hear you	0
She said to do it	0
You are on the right track but youre saying it wrong	0
All right	0
Yeah how do you do this	0
No because that is away a bit that doesnt belong there	0
Marco Im going to ask you a question	0
I dont understand where to start off	0
You can do it separate too because you can divide by two and then divide by Pi	0
For example four one became grew to so the only thing I would add here was I would change this to to grew to or became	0
I was just	0
Oh you guys I explained that wrong	0
I have a question to ask	0
Okay	0
Now we all know that Mr Parker doesnt just let it go with thats why because I said so	0
Okay	0
Thats all it does	0
You have learned in Form One okay	0
and then four five five six six and then seven	0
Triangle plus rhombus plus trapezoid equals one whole	0
So like Valentina had right there shes got a big page of work	0
Right	0
Just adding to it	0
Im sorry	0
Find those critical parts	0
Ill happily look at that for you since Im done passing stuff	0
72 73	0
It goes in once twice three	0
The one labeled X is that one day after they finished their prayers and	0
Yes write that down	0
And then x equals four when y equals seven	0
Max just said Guys this is fractions	0
Now I have to do the exact same with this one	0
Unless I know you are leaving you missed all of the math that I was teaching	0
Okay heres something that I always do	0
Ok well Beth lets see if Beth can explain it to you and be  sure you all agree and come up and write up why you think  that works	0
We have two people with questions	0
Two X plus 10 equals two brackets X plus five	0
These are something weve already learned	0
Oh I didnt notice that last one	0
Thats a good part of it	0
Ok I see  two different solutions possibly or two different arguments you have  to convince us they re correct	0
I m ready to hear from you	0
Youre about ready to stop	0
Yes to me that would be left	0
And I was like well that was close to his	0
Okay	0
No	0
Good	0
Take a little bit of time draw a positive slope and a negative slope	0
We need two thirds of a cup for the first one	0
Theres four out of five and then since that 12 well one and 12 is there and one and 12 plus one and 12 or one and 12 times two is actually four so that would have to be half of 34 so it would be one and 12	0
smaller model	0
So we have all of this	0
Not one out of 10	0
I only need the one number friends this should be easy for all of you if you are missing this you need to do some serious work	0
And a whole minus a whole equals zero	0
Okay lets talk about the example	0
You have pages 37 and 38 for homework	0
It s right up there 34 times 23	0
Look it made a perfect square which tells us it is	0
You could do it that way	0
Oh no that was pretty much it	0
Okay	0
Right	0
Oh gosh	0
Okay so if I have 12 divided by two what this is saying is that I am going to take this number which has a name this numbers name is the dividend	0
and I dont have a lot of room	0
And Jamal think about the rise thats up and down and the run is side to side	0
The perimeter	0
Paul let him pass you by	0
Its kind of like a more permanent version of a tent	0
Twos writing ones coaching	0
Stop so youre going to write it in standard form or notation and in words	0
Yes	0
So Im going to highlight this one Emily	0
You cannot because if you move this from here to here then what youre saying is somehow  this household all of a sudden need another person	0
See if that helps you	0
Three four five six	0
So three Y positive three Y and this is negative four Y Subtraction	0
Well I know that 3 x 4 is going to give me 12	0
Okay so we would say diagonals	0
I liked hers cause she had like	0
Lets look at this problem	0
Now also here we always moved to the side first which means we always go horizontal first	0
And then take one of these straws try to find out the position in which the straw can be placed to obtain the longest straw	0
30 comes out	0
Michael didnt Meredith did	0
Please dont run	0
Oh lets do it this way	0
Let me check and see if its correct	0
Just us two	0
And then it says emojis and symbols	0
Okay	0
Okay so this is going to be 55	0
And two by two squared is also eight	0
We were looking for a hundred out of 160	0
Im going to ask you to come here	0
Two two	0
You might not have enough time to build them all I would like if you  just talk about them I don t think you ll have time to get them all up  there	0
Im going to give you one that I want you to think about after somebody teaches us this one	0
Okay	0
All right heres a nice little for you tangent lines that meet only once parallel lines that never meet asymptotes that get closer and closer but can never be together	0
Then I used the purple pieces to see that it would be like 612 on each side so then I would take away the two that I used to find that and then it would be 1012 but then you can also convert that to 56	0
This point number two	0
I disagree with Sarah because if you use the gummy sharks for the length and width you could just like This is how many gummy sharks how long it is or how tall it is	0
Lets take the number 63	0
Okay so tomorrow were going to be focusing on is slope but were going to be looking at slope just when I give you the two points no graph no table Im just going to give you two points	0
Yes	0
What do you learn if you copy it from the answer book	0
Were starting with a fraction and dividing that into parts	0
All right crew lets look at number four	0
There was a bunch of stuff	0
40 plus four	0
This is a recipe for spaghetti sauce	0
Should we write that	0
See the big word in	0
I want to see your revisions in a different color	0
Remember with the straw	0
Red	0
Seven	0
Let me just ask you a question	0
Question four is what we are working on	0
So our goal today is about defining equivalent ratios or ratios that are equal to each other	0
I can see I can see 43 one	0
Okay some definite confusion on this one	0
Were going plus for every time so thats where the four n is coming from plus for every time and then Notice that we could write plus zero for the y intercept which is here and here	0
So think about vocabulary when youre writing this	0
Two	0
So the next one is three fours minus onethird	0
Here we go	0
Right	0
Yes I do	0
All right	0
Does the answer have to be 1 through 9	0
So we are going to do solving one step equation solving two step equations solving equations with variables on both sides solving equations that involve distribution and combining like terms and then rearranging formulas and solving literal equations	0
Thank you for being so patient with everyone and I will randomly call on someone using the sticks and stop sharing and ask to see your whiteboard	0
I want you to try one Felicia	0
This is important	0
Okay so if our unit is apples everybody picture apples in your head	0
I see you wrote Its going to look different	0
So we have eight times seven length times width	0
Yes there you go	0
One and a half	0
Those are your starting points right there	0
And then compare the sides	0
Horizontal	0
Good	0
You gave us another blank sheet	0
Oh I see	0
Thats really good thinking to try it out that way	0
Is it right	0
Get ready to show me your whiteboards in 321	0
So lets take the information out of that	0
For your math message	0
Okay theres two important things that you need to think about how much money do they have at the start	0
You and your partner are going to get together I dont want you calculating	0
It means theres 25 total	0
Sorry	0
Renata says I did 5  1 is 5  1 is 6	0
Okay	0
Write that	0
How will we be successful	0
So so Brian Michael is offering another way of thinking about that  red as being one sixth	0
And then I think he added together this column here and this column here to get to 20	0
Let s continue with the next step and see what we  have	0
13 not a function as well because the line crosses two times all the way through	0
These might be probably use some of those as review for tomorrow	0
5315	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Go	0
Okay thats a claim with evidence	0
Alright were gonna watch a quick learnzillion video that will help you with comparing decimals and then we have some more things to talk about and do	0
Obviously its just on paper because it says the perimeter of this rectangle of 752 inches they give you one side but they want to know the area	0
Im gonna Show you the answers	0
If we know that our equals like the area of the large square	0
No	0
58 inches tall	0
But I have to  Oh no they didnt	0
What 678 910 next line 911 1213 1415 1617 18 19 20 and I made four groups	0
Youre thinking about justify	0

My tens place	0
What	0
If you listen for a second then I will tell you exactly	0
Okay	0
And Ill be reminding that you have that every single day	0
Okay how about the bottom	0
Yeah	0
a divided by b is the ratio of those two coefficients right there	0
This is the one thing I love about partial quotients	0
Let me find what Im looking for	0
So youre going to open your  pieces	0
Uh OK you see where the	0
Im gonna stop talking now let people get to work	0
Well lets say you have a two game series	0
Thanks for having your CER out Ethan thats awesome	0
imAll right my loves Here we go	0

Do they have to be the same	0
Absolutley	0
So for these questions theres only two parts	0
just because thats the label on here	0
I dont care about what kind of method you use so please think about if you do this you can buy 230yen cakes	0
So minus five	0
Good	0
Now this is very important to understand the difference of because as Ive stated what you guys have learned through your years of drawing things for fun is like Mommy I drew a line	0
One divided by threefourths	0
Thats fantastic	0
Kind of	0

You two	0
And yeah I cant believe its already	0
Yeah	0
Not in our world	0
Lubos is finished	0
What do you want to do	0
All right now we have to find the base and the height of the triangles	0
Where did you come up with three S and that minus	0
Stand up hand up pair up	0
We are explaining my ideas and I thought there was one that was about talking about other people	0
And the smaller the denominator the bigger the pieces	0
Yeah	0

Put your hand down	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Yeah okay	0
I see everyone agrees	0
Maybe a little bit more because it looks like	0
What I am doing is I am using different size fraction circles to create a half	0
That becomes three S and in between brackets minus S plus three	0
When we work in opposites we get the answer and that ladies and gentlemen is how you do an in and out box	0
So notice our slope is minus one and a half	0
Those of you that are seated go to the front table Rebecca Vicki Roberto and Roge go to the front table	0

Talk to your neighbor and come up with an explanation of why that makes sense	0
The cat has to eat the same amount each day	0
You would have to take half of 3	0
And then in addition to that S times S squared	0
I seriously wonder whats going on here	0
All right were looking pretty good on this one	0
The correct answer should look just like that I dont need the zero if Im rounding it to the tenth	0
Thats not too smart	0
Can I come back in two minutes and check in on you guys	0

Then we need to divide that between our 20 pieces of data	0
This is for every two cans of six	0
Okay	0
Youre probably going to lose by a lot	0
And if youre not sure how to use it Im going to have a math help session later at from one oclock to 145 where you can come in and we can talk about how you use this	0
But later on in another example people are going to put repeats in	0
Your vocab word today is histogram	0
Six times eight six times four nine times nine	0
See I sort of switched it on you	0
The second one negative slope	0
Yes	0
Im coming to	0

So lets prove it	0
Thats the changing value that has to go on the X and start to 300 perfectly done	0
Maybe if we got the question if we understood the  question that might help us	0
So therefore instead of rise over run meaning youd go up and to the right with the negative youre going to instead go down and to the right	0
I want you to start off here	0
It is okay if you dont finish but were going to check number two together in just a moment	0
Yeah	0
Ok	0
You took part of the whole and made it a fraction	0
Day 6 is tricky so leave it for last	0
So thinking about this he wants 400 stories	0

No I read left to right regardless	0
Im not saying I dont agree  that it works but I dont know why it works	0
Would I know all of them doing it like that	0
So that we can check our answers maybe	0
I know that one thing that is tricky some people have Once you figured out which color is the 15  15 on the back of it  or at least some of them I think thats been helpful	0
All right	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
If you would please do review of volume which is on page 106 and the math fractions on page 107	0
Yes Marcoua	0
If theres if it doesnt say it in the equation then you just write that zero it has to go through the origin	0
And then  thats the fiTeachert thing	0
All right youre going to title your notes today Just division	0

Okay	0
I guess	0
Then look what he has highlighted include a	0
Okay so let me draw a picture of what that looks like	0
I wish I could get a better grade there	0

Can you help me  yesterday	0
If the coordinates of isosceles trapezoid so just going to circle isosceles trapezoid and draw a quick picture of what an isosceles trapezoid might look like	0
One box is three and a third	0
So y equals and remember y equals mx plus b just going to remind you of that were going to talk about this a lot this week	0
I did the other homework	0
Yes sorry I	0
No youre going from here to here	0
Okay now I want to show you a very similar problem	0
Okay	0
Look you have already got the the instructions	0
I know some of you already did that	0
We went up to three point eight seven four two six four  eight	0
Oh okay	0
This is going to be hard	0
And then we figured out that three fifths is a smallest because its less than half	0
Notice how range over here is pointing towards the X or sorry towards the y values and domain is pointing towards the x values	0
Awesome	0
So can you label the parts	0
Okay but that would  answer	0
I think maybe	0
I need to hide the responses	0
and I have y one whole	0
MIssy has them written down here	0
Scroll up a little bit	0
Ooo okay	0
Oh you did them exactly right	0

Yep Im just looking to see if anybody did it differently	0
And when I say go youre going to submit	0
Okay	0
Okay and you should get 18 equals n So this would be the 18th figure	0
Ladies and gentlemen if I asked this question no if we were dealing with wholes four is definitely not equal to 40	0
Okay so all right lets start again	0
Cassidys has more water so its going to be a little bit more watered down	0
okay so all we know for this one is opposite angles congruent	0
And its okay if we abbreviate when we do this	0
Yes	0
All right	0
So were going to talk about the independent variable which is the input and the dependent variable to the output	0
And Im going to take the  yellow half and you get the purple half	0
And then one two and three	0
And you can imagine there are twentyseven of those  one third meter lengths right in the nine meters of  ribbon	0

How fast can you go	0
Okay	0
It was	0
Whatever is in the tenths place Hank	0
And were actually going to have a little discussion about not just graphing but also what I wanted you to discover about these lines all right	0
Thats when you flip it outside down to get the zero	0
Thank you for sharing your great thinking	0
All parts of that constructive response are absolutely vital to our success	0

So now I will draw a very straight line Ah not too bad	0
That sound good to everybody	0
You got to just write it down here though okay instead of up with the set of problems	0
We did the mental math	0
When I do this what Im going to look for is if I start with this one here Im looking for three people or three responses of one	0
You shouldve had 1 and 56	0
You reflect on your thinking and keep trying when the problem is hard	0
Okay	0
Yeah eight	0
Its going to be okay	0

That might be a little easier for you to try	0
You always start by moving to the side first	0
Think about the math vocabulary you need in that rule for this should make sense to anyone who reads it	0
I picked my favorite mistakes here that I wanted to talk with you about	0
I know its a little frustrating but I want to make sure that were good to go on all	0
And that should work	0
You should just know	0
Thats a great idea	0
Its 45	0
X term the same two X	0
And I know theres a lot of steps to each of these problems	0
Okay	0
Draw a picture of what question number one wants you to do	0
Okay let me go back	0
You dont need to write it on your coins and pouches but Im going to have you write another equation in a second	0
Then I can divide it by 3 which is 1 and then I times 15	0
Look at this	0
So hes got 12 and 0 write that	0

To be fair Gregory	0
Yes	0
So wed like to put out If youd like to draw  If youd like to draw out an ordered value bar graph on your desk	0
You need to make sure you give these all back to him because then Tuesday when you come in youre doing the level twos and the level fours when you get your level twos what do you need to do on your scan sheet	0
Guys Ill tell you right now	0
Okay	0
So lets do the next one	0
That s lovely thank you  Jackie	0
Okay	0

One	0
And you youve answered these questions to the best of your ability Now obviously today we have no time to discuss it okay	0
So now Ive got that filled in	0
When you guys	0
Each X represents a student	0
So even though we have all these weird numbers theyre actually not that hard to get to a percent	0

Awesome	0
Yeah so I just drew a dot here and here	0
Yes	0
They do seem very similar	0
We are going to be doing more of this	0
Yep you can do it that way	0
Okay  let s get started	0
Okay	0
One two three four	0
Because you only have 210 yen in cash	0
So remember that each row is 16 26 theres going to be a whole lot of xs here 36 46 and 56	0
Try to put it into words	0

Sh	0
Just its a good idea to save things	0
They go in the bucket the pink bucket	0
Good	0
Im just going to call it a T	0
Were going to go ahead and start with our ratio table	0
Thats what I just heard	0
Okay and remember our answers negative two	0
All right	0
Something that I see	0
And how about unlikely	0
On three were going to read the learning intention together	0
I have faith in you	0
I only made one cut	0
The first is 15 then the second is two times five plus five	0
Those are resources for you to study resources for you to use during the test	0
Keep that there	0
First one	0
And if you imagine you rotate around this point it should end up like that 180 degrees	0
Okay beware the first couple questions not that much work to show	0
Again going back to our original prompt	0
No	0
All right cool	0
no one and a half Yeah	0
Do you have three oranges we can  borrow	0
YMCA its fun to stay at the YMCA	0
When youre done raise your hand and Ill check your work and youll have a little time for math games	0

Did anyone say I know Ms Tolliver area is length times width	0
On the blackboard there are two different equations	0
Welcome welcome welcome	0
You just didnt so wheres your eraser	0
Ok	0
Great	0
51	0
I will do it in the order that we did it so that you do get the correct answer	0
Yeah	0
So were going to look at some recipes today	0
Um seven times eight is 56	0
That one is not as quite straight forward but there is a distinct pattern there if you pay attention	0
Then he did 5 x 4  20	0
All right	0
Try to think about if you somehow can use the fact that it is high that you have a box high like this	0
Okay	0
Thats so simple	0
While youre at it you might want to double check mine to make sure I didnt mess up	0
And so if you want to figure out whats happening in this table you just look at these two points	0
The number of chaperones were going to need 35 chaperones and were going to have 207 people on our trip	0
Were going to take a look at surf times	0
Okay awesome	0
Yeah	0
And when we do the vertical line test in just a moment were going to see okay well when the the vertical lines actually go through five points because theres five arrows coming off the five	0
And now Im going to divide 141 by three	0
It still works Meredith thinks	0
Okay theyre all different	0
You got it	0
So its a half	0
What should we name it	0
Okay	0
Yep	0
Compared to you Im three times older than you	0
I think the trapezoid will be twice as wide because I will multiply the Xcoordinates by two	0
Okay	0
That would make it better in your ordered pair	0
The ideas that you came up with for filling in the bracket were	0
So now this is our original so just look in our learning intention and success criteria	0
So its always at x equals four	0
Because in the long run youd get more	0
Still talking	0
Use fraction circle pieces or not for finding the answer to that top one 15 plus 110	0
Okay	0
Teach it	0
Im curious if youre using the same words that Im using	0
If every person came and either opened or closed every single locker this would be the easiest question in the history of the world	0
Look up at the board thats how you are going to be successful	0
I just wish I could get the line	0
Did you guys have similar	0
Next one	0
Right	0
So kind of the way I think about it is the comparison is this if every x value has one arrow that means that your vertical line is only going to cross one time	0
If you cant be safe you cant sit in a chair	0
Yes	0
Lets try that again	0
Therefore I find four X is equal to 15	0
Youve done the original sailboat and you should only be working on the new sailboat number one	0
We need to know how many chaperones we will need	0
So you have 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8	0
You added a very important part there that you were about to leave out	0
Thats okay	0
Okay	0
Together were going to read 1 2 3	0
Were going to talk about this Notes section here at the top	0
Were going to let everyone think	0
Im going to do the problem for you just on a different piece of paper	0
Were going to think about a time on the clock and I want you to make it with these	0
These were assigned to us as well	0
Six doesn t work okay	0
So were going to talk about the basics right now	0
Read it a few times to make sure you understand the problem	0
Anytime you get to go to Red Rocks	0
Now it is	0
So lets see if it works	0
Thats what our goal was anyways	0
If youre not doing this along with me and Hunter you need to follow along	0
Were going to bring that decimal down	0
Lets go think about the size of the shapes	0
Why not	0
Charles said I have to multiply them all by six	0
I have no idea	0
Yeah it feels like a Friday	0
Uhm for now okay	0
Good	0
Well since its right next to	0
Well see the difference but I dont have anymore orange	0
Subitizing	0
And Ill discuss what youve been doing	0
Okay	0
Stand with someone not at your table but in the vicinity of a table	0
What math would you have to do to get X equals 2	0
Subtraction	0
Hopefully Miss kaylea and miss J youre getting some answers too	0
I have an answer	0
You guys worked with tape diagrams	0
I usuRamona pick a number that I can use for mental math because this lets me know that eight yerts can hold 48 people	0
And you can show me right here everybody doesnt need to see your answer	0
So Rosie drew a seven four and a three and made her dividend 74	0
Good	0
3 goes into six but 8 doesnt	0
Miss	0
Okay yeah Kelly you should have already done this	0
2Y equals 180	0
I dont know	0
Where is the	0
I want you to look at the picture	0
And were going to figure out how are they the same as parallelograms because all of these are parallelograms	0
And we will go over that in this lesson	0
Okay	0
Eight more than Lindas nine bookmarks eight bookmarks 17 bookmarks	0
Daphne make sure to simplify that fraction	0
Okay because you  said fewer a minute ago	0
Okay	0
Were going to ask question but one	0
Awesome	0
Oh	0
A bit smaller	0
All right	0
Im going to actually just make some groups of four today based on who I think would do really well in math	0
Get closer Camila so I can see	0
There you go	0
Im not going to do that	0
Okay I think a lot  of people have come up with something	0
Im going to specifically work with a couple of groups	0
You see how that works	0
Now the last one I want to talk about is imagine if its this like a dot dot dot 10 meters per second	0
So now lets see if it works	0
Okay	0
One two three four five six seven	0
Erik is making a face	0
I dont understand your answer	0
We want to think about  how these two compare	0
8 plus four is 12	0
After you look for it	0
Are you talking about this	0
Word pictures and models	0
For example look at this collection	0
No but the first pick before Janessa	0
descending value	0
Did you get the same thing for Number 1 and decide who got the correct answer	0
One two three four five bends	0
Okay	0
Thats this way using partial quotients	0
Yes because I am not sure if I understand it	0
You dont do it in that way	0
Because	0
From your desks do what you need to do to be together	0
Hidden treasure	0
I think you have muted me	0
I know	0
A trapezoid and then a square	0
Same thing as going down 10 over five	0
One two three four five six seven eight	0
All right	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Excellent	0
right	0
Were going to multiply the two numbers on the outside of the box	0
Okay	0
So five divided by two would be two with a remainder of one or two and a half which is between the numbers two and three	0
Were working on a four by six	0
Okay	0
So the square of A the square of A is nine	0
Maybe we wont	0
Right	0
Surface area is four Pi times 30  squared	0
I love math most in fact teaching	0
So you know that four avocados is eight so that means and then four	0
110	0
Complete case number two with your solution	0
And so really yesterday and today I really want us to focus on like understanding what slope is	0
Were going to take one straight break today in the middle of class and then Im hoping that we have a little bit of time at the end for you to get started on your homework	0
Lets get another piece of paper	0
Its a funny joke Ive never heard that	0
Good having you	0
Why	0
Segment bisector is very similar but a little bit more broad than the actual midpoint	0
Im going to put my 2 on the outside	0
Dont Im just asking for some feedback	0
Sentence number three says For every tablespoon of oil there are 2 cups of tomato sauce and 5 teaspoons of oregano	0
Okay	0
So a basic fact is eight times three is 24	0
Youre making it too difficult	0
You could Y2 trade the exponent for the Y2 on this	0
That was very nice	0
Can you please go and talk with Kennedy	0
John where are your fraction circles	0
I think everybody except for like three people came to the material pickup last week	0
Convex polygon everything is point outwards	0
So domain is 74147 74147	0
Were doing the easy side only	0
So Im going to erase the multiplication symbol	0
Theyre so happy to be in nature	0
Awesome	0
Kind of then	0
You can t just look for the word of and assume that you guys are multiplying	0
Minus	0
When I out and I come back	0
Thank you	0
Youre starting with the area which is the total and so that means you have to divide to get the other side	0
You could do two different ways you could look at how much youre going to get off this one youre going to get 60 off this one youre going to get 45 off plus 1050 which is 5550 so this one youre going to get a bigger discount or then you could take your 1051050 which is 9450	0
So problems one and two page one 69	0
So you get zero over negative six	0
So I am multiplying but the process	0
All right	0
If I want to know just what number is 20 of 80 it would be 16	0
You want to get started	0
Okay so remember slope triangles kind of look like this	0
So part of that today is like were going to see some other equations and the ones we have been next week were gonna like really get down to business on equations	0
Six	0
Okay	0
Let s make sure everybody remembers	0
Okay	0
Otherwise you guys are going to have chaos	0
Yeah	0
plot connect the dot	0
Okay thank you	0
Its Jeff  youre convincing	0
The twos cancel and	0
All right	0
Mhmm	0
I heard that ones a big thats a big saying for for for carrot farmers as well	0
So Im not trying to trick you on this	0
And the pledge	0
So super important that you remember which order	0
Its not included	0
Yeah	0
Yep	0
Will some be missing of the card	0
And were going to be talking about midpoint and slope today	0
Hey Ethan  we need to make sure we  everybody that	0
Is it four ninths	0
Oh thats okay	0
Tom and Luis I need you guys	0
This means if your xvalue is positive you d be going this way first	0
So let me look at yours too Issac	0
You went to five	0
But just the picture looks slightly different	0
Bom bom	0
So I just want us to notice here Im going to draw on this arc	0
So youre saying two	0
Go back to your shared screen	0
And I am not kidding you	0
Hunter can you do me a favor and go close the door for me	0
Then	0
Awesome	0
You can do it on your whiteboard	0
No	0
Were going to start off with some mental math today just to get our brains thinking about math	0
All right	0
All right	0
All right	0
So we know what youre going to use one of which two operations here	0
Yeah	0
I think she really likes eggs what do you think	0
Then multiply the number of rods of that ladder by two and then subtract two	0
Now then well okay	0
You should not have decimal points in these	0
Add the left side of the equal sign to the left side of the other equal sign	0
okay sweet	0
Weve got that	0
At one we had an outcome of 15 that is over here	0
And Rylee be careful with your subtraction in the bottom there should be the same as the last slide	0
Yeah	0
If you wanted to you can just fill like a dot dot dot	0
Okay so youre right on the  how you did	0
Its not really a square	0
Another thing you could do is start by graphing or filling out the table	0
Its parallel	0
Yes	0
You guys knew that it needed cheese	0
Mm hm	0
You do not have 02 Penny	0
Can we write on our paper	0
You guys sit in the same proximity where you were sitting before	0
Three comma negative five translation vector	0
Some very very big  fish	0
Okay	0
They will not touch any of these lockers	0
C	0
Ooh	0
I am confused	0
To put the 12 first then 46 and then 120 and then 290	0
Multiplicative identity property	0
Three hours to fly from Chicago to Alberta Canada	0
Or the way I did it with Zach after he figured out well we need a 12th	0
Okay so your slope is negative two	0
Were going to look at a couple more ratio tables here	0
It only intersects at one point	0
So you re thinking it works a little bit different than what s up here in the date that we ve gathered	0
79 go ahead	0
Because it is one unknown one equation	0
Because Im going to step right on you	0
Okay	0
I would like you to write down your answer Im going to give you about a minute or two minutes to do this	0
What I would do is I would do it this way	0
I thought you needed to go to the restroom	0
And did you finish	0
Lets go to mine	0
All right were batting a thousand	0
Give her a power clap	0
I  know its hard I have trouble counting when its not nearby when  theres so many little pieces	0
Now weve done the first part	0
We are going to learn how to add decimals by aligning putting in a line the decimals	0
If you count in one by one you get negative one is the exact middle	0
Way bigger	0
Now were switching gears to volume is like how many cubes can you fit the shape	0
Okay	0
I was going to add that they got that you have to divide 332 but then they wanted to use the common denominator of 12 that we had of the common denominator	0
So then the middle one is the y	0
Okay very good	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Because there are four of those of those numbeTeacher with three ones and one zero	0
Okay	0
I just forgot my trade	0
How about putting whole number on the line	0
Youre okay	0
Alright	0
I love when Im so prepared	0
There you go	0
So at the end of the conversation somebody should be able to explain all of the steps	0
now whats the opposite of that would be a totally vertical line that like this would be impossible to walk on	0
The rise should be the y values and then the run should be the x values	0
Oh yes	0
I want you to teach you a little shortcut to finding tax	0
If you use multiplication	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
This is what a straight edge if you correctly will look like	0
Oh yeah you are going to use your boards	0
And were looking pretty good on those things	0
The divisor is always outside the house because that is what I am dividing it by	0
Ah	0
Okay	0
All right	0
Two four six eight 10 12 14 16 18 20	0
If youre having trouble getting started what I would recommend is just put in three numbers	0
The hypotenuse I dont know yet	0
Yes	0
So those of you that were stuck why dont you put your hands down give people that were stuck a chance to think about this	0
So useful to know that your 30 60 90 triangles	0
Its kind of blurry I think Dane think about what your y intercept is and thats what number should go with zero in your table	0
If you add this part and this part it makes the whole length	0
very good	0
That is a question we can look up later	0
We say that two X plus 10 is identically equal two bracket two uh X plus five	0
Final answer and thats a lot of numbers	0
Okay so here is what Im hearing you say	0
Here label it I	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Come here first	0
This way is the positives	0
This is not proportional	0
No	0
Can you guys please come put your stations on the rug for me please	0
So this right here I really like this diagram but think about it  so you just have angles on this but think about if it were rolling  you can roll it out  what would it be like if you kind of did what they did in the video where it had like here here and here	0
Okay	0
Maybe you can do on this paper separate	0
Excuse me	0
But you dont have to if you dont want to	0
Thanks for the thinking through this stuff	0
All right lets go	0
No lets work here	0
Wait for steps	0
Lets do it	0
Yes	0
Do you know what she is	0
So let me explain whats going on Mr Isaiah	0
Okay hands down	0
Great	0
Thank you	0
If there are 33 students in the class and all of them are wearing either sneakers or boots	0
Yeah from last year	0
Im seeing correct digits but not the right answer how is that possible	0
If you do this  by half	0
It was actually very easy I might have struggled a little bit I dont understand it	0
Erase your boards clean	0
Very good	0
Ive got to look into why that keeps happening	0
Every decimal number can be represented on a place value chart because each digit has a different place value	0
Nope thats totally fine darlin	0
So this is a very real world problem	0
OK so you re saying three choose one plus three choose two equals four choose two	0
Ms Strathom	0
I want to see at least two different sames and two different differences	0
I need you to model this with your fraction circles	0
Uh ladies ladies and gentlemen when you are working I would like it to be more quiet	0
Check your work	0
Im going to make sure that we all understand those things before we get going	0
You ll have to help me with this	0
Okay	0
Yes we changed it times five	0
You got your signs flipped	0
Heres your joke of the day	0
Your title is multiplication wrestling and Im going to give you some more information in just a minute	0
Fortytwo	0
Too bad it rained but I bet you made the best of it	0
I want you to try something on your own ratio table	0
Mmhmm	0
Im not doing this twice	0
All right	0
Or youre missing something	0
Im going to assume that youre good at the basics now	0
Theres parent teacher conferences on those nights	0
Okay	0
Now what it allows you to do is you say that angle plus that angle plus	0
So one picture that I saw is like if youre if youve got an improper or if youve got a mixed number they break apart the whole number	0
Oh my gosh thats going to be so much fun	0
Ill see you later	0
You dont want	0
Okay	0
River and Asher you can clip up when were done on the floor	0
So the first one is two and zero	0
Youre right  This is really more of a sage and scribescribe	0
I have pulled my next name I do not know if this persons going to be able to get their microphone to work but were going to see	0
Yes difficult	0
Okay	0
So I would always just start with the y intercept think about what part of your equation is going to be y equals something because its a straight line and its not vertical	0
Okay	0
So negative three is six zero is eight	0
You could have done it better	0
Ill give you my  and then I want to solve it	0
Okay	0
All right	0
I will give you a sheet that were gonna work on today that you can take notes on	0
Come on just get it done quickly	0
Okay and I want to write out a couple things before I let you actually try out the next problem	0
I hope you get this	0
And your goal I would hope is that you learn something new	0
Okay	0
So you are going to create your own rule right here where the book the original picture we have seen this many times You need to write a rule where the book is going to be kind of larger	0
What is going on	0
So the snaps were three one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12	0
Just a minute	0
So what we did guys is we gave you the answers to them	0
Keep going gentlemen	0
I will know I am successful when I can model and accurately divide whole numbers by unit fractions on problems of one and two on page 119 so you are dividing and multiplying	0
And what it can go up to if I round it to	0
Im going to divide them up into groups that are the size of one and a half	0
Thats why ratio tables are so nice	0
And took all your  hell manage  and take all your rods all your  boxes why dont you try building Davids model and see if it works	0
Lefthand side and righthand side	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
No	0
Its different from asking to have half a Japanese radish you know	0
It wont be exactly what the shape would look like	0
Huh huh	0
She has 12 she eats 23 of that 12 so what I would like you to do is you are going to and Ill bring this up so you can see it youre going to fold it evenly kind of like a burrito	0
Asher tell me	0
Do you have some paper	0
One fourth on top of the long fraction bar	0
I can	0
Okay	0
Which one is that	0
Okay good	0
Step 1	0
I would like you to try number six together again	0
Okay	0
Expand it out on your paper	0
How about we start with that question this afternoon	0
All right	0
Okay	0
I turn this off its just going to record this	0
Yeah	0
And make sure everybody click on that link for me please Right weve got	0
What a smart class	0
But 200 is 210ths	0
If you scroll down theres three exceed links	0
60	0
Twelve each please	0
We were not alive at that point	0
That was what I was hoping someone would say	0
First we have 13 of 12	0
Okay	0
Eight	0
Now some people are telling me Ankur says no numbers work and Matt says one works	0
Maybe the  problem is there isnt a lot of space when you use  the overhead pen it takes a lot of room	0
Lisa yes	0
Go up up up up	0
What do you want us to go on to	0
So I have to take	0
Its a reEy valuable opportunity to reEy have a word sort of marinate in their minds	0
When its a tie numerator and denominator have the same degree we always get again a horizontal asymptote at Y equals to eight divided by B	0
Five correct	0
The ingredients below are for one batch	0
Any equivalent fraction any fraction equal to one	0
Yes it is 415	0
Right	0
I can use a diagram to represent a recipe a double batch and a triple batch of a recipe	0
So Isaac had us pull out a whole one at a time until we couldnt anymore	0
Five	0
We have five cups of flour and two cups of vanilla	0
So I look at the nearest whole number which would be in my ones place then I have to go to the position thats in the tenths place	0
Not very many people are doing that much work on IXL so far this week so thats something you could definitely do	0
What Id like you to do now whether youre done or not guys I honestly hope that all of you have learned something today	0
Explain by representation	0
By the end of fifth grade	0
Thats what I did	0
Its always forgotten	0
So 14 is a unit fraction	0
So were going to get startedon this homework	0
Strathom I know	0
They all got us to the same number	0
And then you find the lower bound	0
Were in battle	0
Show me	0
That is what we saw several times yesterday	0
Yes but its not what the questions asking	0
It has been one month since Ichiros mother has entered the hospital	0
Okay because its not like make it negative or make it positive	0
But maybe if you want to make sure of things before you do it	0
What I need to do is I need to get them all on one side of the fence first	0
Every time	0
no Spencer tell me were doing the exact same thing we did yesterday	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Actually were not going to solve it one step at a time	0
And then just a reminder this symbol here means congruent	0
You dont need it because its in your book	0
Four	0
Okay	0
We graph them and so pretRayne quick to find the equation of the line because we have the Yintercept	0
Five	0
Okay	0
You are going to solve an openresponse	0
Its just less than one	0
From here to here is the triangle	0
Put them into your em4 documents and do your math boxes	0
I like what Simon was saying	0
What this is actually asking us is in other words how many sets of 14 are in 12	0
So you have two three yeah 2345 and then five again	0
Okay so thats kind of what youre looking at today youre going to have some time to start talking about it in small groups how you would go about labeling your pizza as youre sharing those pizzas	0
Yes and then  working I totally did not regard your directing	0
Okay	0
Pull it out of your binder so that you dont have your binder on your desk so that when I can come around I will do that	0
a little more than half	0
Youre going to turn in both with your name on it	0
But theres one key element that a decimal has to have that not all fractions have to have	0
So youre going to shade one third in one direction	0
And then they each got a half right here	0
230	0
If I were to think about this backwards lets say Y stands for the year I was born	0
Yes	0
Its not getting back	0
Were going to go to specials and we will finish this lesson when we return	0
Thats what I want to see from you guys	0
Um	0
Yeah	0
Good job on the first learning	0
You didnt type in eight	0
I can come work in a group too	0
So Maria I am going to work with you on do you have a dry erase marker that I could borrow	0
Like this	0
Youve heard the word rate	0
after the one half	0
This one	0
There are lots of reasons why people enjoy Costco	0
Six and the five because its only one over	0
Im going to multiply	0
Okay Stephanie is doing six	0
Corner	0
We had twothirds	0
Here is what you are doing	0
Okay	0
Now think carefully about that	0
Thats how big a piece is	0
Think I saw almost everybody in the class jumped right in and get both of those questions right	0
The races	0
This doesnt work	0
This one is made like this on the bottom side like this	0
So that is also a true statement	0
Because reading left to right that means left is smaller than the right	0
Um	0
Okay	0
Im not looking for the product of this	0
Come and get that	0
Okay we have some bakers in the room	0
Its gonna get harder	0
So we are closest to one still	0
If you look that makes sense because this is 35 and this is 15 so 35 is 3 times bigger than the 15	0
Heres what theyre trying to make you think	0
I told you	0
You havent said anything in a while huh	0
So the y intercept is 01	0
So weve got blue  red red red	0
Okay	0
Yes if I go It kind of splits the clock in half	0
Oh we have a lot of  unsure people here	0
I want most friends who were trying to	0
Okay Haley buddy	0
This right here this fourth thats left over this is half of how much we would need for our next piece	0
Okay	0
Well talk through it	0
One	0
So minus 47 minus 47	0
So tonight youre going to look at same their claim and youre going to decide who do you feel like is best representing the data	0
6000 8 tens and one is 6081	0
Get in there buddy	0
We just need another radius	0
I did one	0
Okay	0
isnt more than a half	0
2200	0
All right what I want you to do cover the yellow pieces with two dark blue pieces	0
A segment into two congruent parts	0
And then Im doing 001 because I have 71 hundredths	0
There we go	0
Lets go everybody should be putting in their teams because youre either playing as me or youre playing as Haven	0
Part of this is filled out for you you can open up to page 60	0
Well do the rest in a minute	0
I want to know what your estimate is and I dont want you to tell me	0
So then lets compare this to Terrances	0
Go to the next page and then the next page	0
Equivalent fractions for two thirds	0
And then you count up all the	0
Because thats the first time where both of those Mr Parker equal each other	0
What do we do with number five again	0
Okay so meet back at 218	0
So 1 8 or 18 was 125	0
Pam pam	0
One	0
You can just calculate the triangle here	0
All right lets check to see how we go	0
It was worth 10 times more	0
Right	0
Is it reRamona 52	0
There you go	0
And they just went too far with it	0
If youre writing in your notebook that means that youre drawing something and youre not doing what youre supposed to be doing	0
17 becomes 10 and 7 34 becomes 30 and 4	0
Now observe the box then put it aside	0
So we were comparing the number of words	0
Perfect	0
Now its time to listen	0
Yes	0
So Im going to multiply this number on the bottom this five by four to get to 20	0
This is 5 18 which thats not a fourth measurement 5 34 I have a whole 6 so thats going to be here	0
All right	0
OK that s the wrong thing this is better	0
Thank you	0
Thanks for doing that everybody	0
Miss  how are we supposed to get a black	0
Do you want me to	0
Yes	0
There you go	0
And were actually going to come back about nine	0
Exactly	0
Do not look around and stand because you see the majority  of the people standing	0
Show me your whiteboard please	0
Okay now I want to show you something for this one	0
Well I bet something if you practice you can get better	0
It shouldn t take you that long	0
So that is our answer for this	0
So 80 times 6 and nine times 6	0
All right	0
Wait are we on C	0
Ive heard some great jobs scaling this up	0
Then the black	0
It might be an idea to get one before your yearly exam	0
Yes	0
Ok we have a new visitor here	0
Next thing I want to do is divide both sides by three	0
And Ian youre exactly right	0
all right Hunter	0
Yeah it doesnt matter	0
Onefourth times two Mr Parker give you twoeighths on this side	0
Thats good	0
Thats okay	0
Okay	0
Dont spend time doing that	0
Thats not an efficient way to do this	0
TRUE	0
All right lets see what you can do	0
You guys talk amongst yourselves you need to make sure that youre talking to each other and just not to yourselves so you guys talk amongst yourselves figure that one out	0
I just want to know if you have the same answers	0
Because here you only have a three left over	0
It changes the roll radius	0
I think you need to stand up and sit down when youre done	0
Heres what Im not understanding with you	0
Vertical I suppose X intercepts Y intercept	0
Whenever I think of a vertical I think of the vertical jump	0
What are you missing	0
So the first one that does not is this	0
So my answer probably unless Im adding another 20 to it	0
All I did was 6 times seven which is 42 you carry the four and 5 times 7 which is 35 and then add 4 35 plus 4 which is 39 and then you add that in there then 392 is your answer	0
I will know Im successful when I can apply one of the strategies practiced in this lesson on problems two and four	0
Sorry do the bottom part	0
Be prepared to explain how you found it	0
Next Not next week tomorrow youre going take a pretest for unit five	0
Okay so usually what the people want us to do is to write something in the box that will make a true statement which I am sure you anticipated	0
Thank you very much	0
Wait	0
Four minutes and you may begin	0
First I did 13 of 8 and then I got 4 so then I just multiplied that by 2	0
Sure	0
Yes you guys are on it	0
Now I heard some great conversations	0
and Im going to subtract	0
That s very interesting	0
Cheung Lung Man do number 20	0
I think Im noticing the numbers on the bottom one two three two four six	0
You did a really nice job of finding your mode	0
Okay I can do that	0
So 23 would have 23 times three and a third	0
Yeah	0
Okay so you should have hopefully a lot of time to get a good start on this	0
Okay so thats 21 fifths	0
Yeah	0
Thank you	0
Were going to be figuring out what this problem is asking	0
I want you to remember that 2 x 2 x 2 is the same as 23	0
Because thats the whole then I did take away 14	0
So for example these are two really good examples for every minute the band marches 45 feet	0
But on page 19 I want you to look at which decimals do you feel like you can fill in without doing some additional work	0
Try it both ways	0
Think about a vertical a jump	0
Id like you to go back and revise the other ones	0
We know how to find the area and we know how to find the perimeter of rectangles	0
I want to see what our class thinks	0
15	0
So using the slope formula find the slope of the line through the given points	0
Okay	0
Um	0
Please do	0
So now we are a hundred percent sure addition does not work	0
What is the coordinates of the park	0
Ill be staying with the Y	0
So I would like you to in your group solve problems one two and 5	0
But thank you for sharing your thinking	0
You got it buddy	0
A quarter times minus a quarter equals minus four	0
I think that if you keep thinking about it you might find some other ways	0
Its not	0
Then Ellie and Mia were having a very intense conversation as well	0
Thats the opposites	0
All right	0
So Im gonna give you time to think about that because youre going to share a whole class	0
I might need your help on how to get to it Mr Strathom	0
Missy go ahead and show me number three	0
All right	0
Lets help him out a little	0
College style	0
Y2 is zero minus Y1 is four	0
Hugo if you can let me see your work on this one	0
Now were going to look at how to actually write this out	0
Okay	0
The second ones a square	0
You found that 112 fit into a 12 and 112 fit into a 13	0
When you were in second or third grade if anybody did the 100meter dash it probably took you around 25 seconds when youre running as fast as you could	0
So our goal for today is to really find a way that we can multiply fractions using what we know about addition and multiplication to multiply fractions	0
Ive given you every tool you can	0
Some of you are going to want to solve these all on your own thats not what Im asking for today	0
Divide by four Pi	0
7 11 and 12 8	0
So I have don t have to keep running back to the board	0
Um its two eighths instead of one eighth	0
So think about real world situations where you use multiplication	0
Now you want to cut  bows that are two thirds meters long	0
One	0
3 and 3 5 number 2	0
I was making sure they were paying attention as well	0
They didnt convince me	0
Zero point	0
I hope you guys have a great rest of your day	0
Okay I hate this	0
That would mean one more step telling you have to multiply it by 3 which makes it way too big	0
SS right person number two	0
You also dont have a notebook with you	0
Heres what I noticed yesterday	0
Hey daddy	0
Do all that good stuff to make your models	0
Yeah we got to distribute the nine	0
Umm yes I guess so	0
All the information we could need	0
Okay	0
Hopefully Im almost ready	0
Yep	0
point three five is less than point four zero	0
Because so you notice this pattern and the  pattern fits Pascals triangle	0
One minute per person	0
I think the answer is seven	0
Revise  means were relooking looking at something and seeing how we can make it better	0
I want you to discuss with your groups again I m gonna give you about a minute   the probability that at least one student in the class will be absent tomorrow	0
So we what	0
Now youre going to have one more digit because its two by two	0
Right	0
Elm street	0
Thanks guys	0
So its not super super worried about number one with everyone	0
So crew if look at this here I want you to notice that Dallas has an eight on her display and then Jada has a 10 on her display	0
Four or less let it rest five or more raise the score	0
So the answer is three eighths	0
Kids who have shared a lot today already	0
Now when we graph it lets see what happens	0
We expressed it showing how it works	0
All right everybody	0
So weve done two thirds with your second part of two thirds and complete the problem and we will talk	0
Okay so now that I have my horns and Im just gonna make this bit one big horn	0
I know but I want to see all your steps	0
Ha yeah it makes	0
Oh okay	0
You have no idea what my question was because your more focused on your buddy Joanna instead of the guy whos up here teaching which is one	0
Two thirds	0
You should divide by four	0
No you did Yes Im sorry	0
So you have a model in this answer	0
Okay	0
No need for those side comments	0
Round up and then add back	0
Yes	0
Heres the link for the Pear Deck if you need it	0
Yes	0
And Charles why where you not participating earlier	0
Get out your	0
I want everyone to put your pencils down and point to your rule	0
Okay	0
You know thats thats like um	0
So I want you to notice well first of all take a look at this graph	0
Awesome	0
your assignment is 95 96 and 97	0
He pretty much does it in the first start it wasnt as much of an average	0
All partners have to come up with something	0
Ways in which theyre the same and ways in which theyre not	0
Okay	0
No	0
Okay	0
Oh I have you on mute	0
Be careful when youre walking	0
Were going have a little discussion about it	0
ameesha got one here sister one got one sister two got one	0
Work with your face partner point to your face partner	0
Okay	0
And after that I will have a couple of questions myself about the calculations that you have learned in your homework	0
Thats a good question	0
An equilateral triangle	0
Conversions when were converting fractions to whole numbers	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
Yeah	0
Absolutely	0
If you want to find a partner for a couple of minutes to talk through what youre doing and then well share	0
How about if we make something and have it like be  impossible	0
Heres our next problem	0
And the Y is always the rise because x is side to side y is up and down	0
All right	0
Okay now stand up and go see what you need to do	0
decimals	0
Everyone else Sit down please	0
Seven	0
Good	0
Okay	0
Now we go to person number seven	0
I dont have any thank you though	0
My fraction was 113	0
Excellent	0
Four divided by three in parentheses	0
Not yet	0
I saw your hand	0
Please stand with someone not at your table	0
2  0  2	0
The table is not really correct because minus four T times two	0
Lets see if its possible to fit evenly in both of those	0
Yes you can just put it right there	0
Some of you must have an internal clock for 20 seconds because you were definitely ready to go at 20 seconds	0
Because you have to round	0
And George youre with Josh	0
Yes please	0
Find C and N So these are opposite corners so if we think about a rectangle weve got this corner weve got this corner	0
Well its actually closer to one whole But then all the other ones	0
Assignment D Let me see you can fill this in the right place which is not the problem	0
Okay were going to move on to the actual lesson	0
Because say if its like one eighth plus one third you have to find a common denominator	0
Okay so and I see a couple people starting in different ways	0
Good	0
You need to figure out what the question is asking you need to make sure that you answer the question first	0
And then the remainder of one which I recorded as a fraction	0
so many times	0
Factor it	0
All right	0
Theres no way that could equal one	0
Okay	0
This is what we did last week before we were on vacation	0
Same thing	0
Be ready	0
Weve got that one over here	0
Lets do that	0
Thank you Nadia	0
And then when you bring your math journals tomorrow you can transfer this information over	0
But theres really steep sidewalks going up and theres really steep sidewalks going down but none of them are like completely vertical	0
Okay	0
So as we kind of go Ill be asking for some people to call you out some stuff on this	0
You did this one correctly	0
Next year when you have six different teachers all day we really got to be flexible about different teachers have different expectations	0
Look at what you wrote there	0
Okay this angle two angles are 90 degrees	0
Teacher arent we allowed to	0
This is not new	0
So lets take a look here	0
zero is just flat	0
Think about the word much and many	0
Had no hair the guy in the tie and cowboy boots	0
We are talking about the number one half	0
Single digit multiplication facts and yes we do go all the way to twelves and as expected in 4th grade that you will memorize all the way to twelve but its basically your single digit facts	0
And then out of that	0
As you cut out talk with your table group about what you have noticed about what you are cutting out what do you notice	0
And Im going to call on some sticks for people to share	0
Thats okay Ill go over and fix it	0
Or to show me why	0
It should I believe	0
Pass the paper to him to see	0
The length is 24 feet the width is 12 of 24	0
I dont know what that is	0
Yes absolutely	0
Does it make sense to you	0
Find partners so I can see who your partners are	0
6 and 110 is less than 6 and 991000	0
I still need you to be focused	0
If I put 12 into the ear and I get out three thats getting smaller	0
Lets see Colin and Abby can you be partners today	0
You can only use oneeighth one time	0
So for example the example that we just went over goodness were Four 1015	0
Please take a look at example five	0
I did Reggies then I did Taras	0
Thats why we now have to think about which one of these four cases really gives us the minus seven X	0
If you have an absolute value in the end you split it up in the two numbers	0
All right	0
Be specific in your description	0
It seems like you guys needed about 15 seconds per person	0
Numerator wins it s oblique	0
Yes in the search	0
It right it looked like I cut it right down the middle I made one cut separating into half like Sadie said	0
You are basically playing along with us	0
You know we have  to help the people who are not sure to understand	0
Wait wait a second okay	0
So I got 21 out of 32	0
I get to work with Mrs Strathom	0
If I do 03 times seven	0
Okay so the first one has four the second one is 12345678	0
I thought it would be equivalent	0
A couple of things I want to remind you of	0
Maybe theyre getting very serious about bodyboarding	0
See if anybody said no	0
Yes	0
It says Admission to Wild World includes a bonus card with a hundred points that can be spent on rides	0
50 has already wrestled everybody	0
Okay so all right you guys know so much about math	0
But you can also just look at the points thats what were going to get to today is only looking at the points for that	0
No I didnt  how did you get it filled out	0
When you have talked about what youre doing then you may think about solving it	0
So make sure you get those done	0
Now Im passing out the pink papers and these are not yours	0
You could talk about what was confirmed	0
This says a ratio is an association between two or more quantities	0
Yes	0
So unit three was kind of big it was the unit we spent the most time on	0
Were thinking of the place value of a decimal addition problem	0
Well what if I do	0
So Im going to tell you right now that that one is not right	0
Okay	0
Okay so never stops never ends	0
So  you have five tenths is less than forty nine hundredths	0
Person A and person B then person A you get a little extra turn	0
Okay	0
I go next door to the hundreths	0
Yeah	0
This one	0
Thats a freehand draw	0
Yellow paint is another one of our parts	0
450 and Victoria	0
Okay and what we ve done in the past is do tallies	0
Okay pencils down pencils down	0
I think I said that at first	0
What else	0
Four more minutes	0
The mean or fair share line	0
Because its going to be were closer to its not even 110	0
And Im going to try and solve that with a box	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
See theres	0
That is definitely multiplication	0
Lets go Aldo get it done	0
Go ahead and write The line of reflection is correct	0
Seven hundred and forty	0
Um 750 centimeters	0
Okay so we want to be able to prove when were looking at diagram when were looking at a picture we want to be able to prove that two things are the same or not the same	0
According to their rule its what it should be	0
Then it says write a fraction addition equation for your answer	0
Friends move on to three and do four and math boxes next	0
Im not going to put the area model up there	0
All right	0
Well talk about this more on Thursday	0
They create nutrients for the soil	0
Who wants to go first	0
When friends come up here to share even if theyre not correct there was a learning behind it	0
And then and then I got and then that equals 20  so and then there was a five in it so so I knew the answer was four	0
Nice job sir	0
I see some  interesting questions have arisen	0
Jack Im going to have you come up here	0
All right	0
Spelled what wrong	0
Ok  you might want to take some notes to sketch it to you  remember what you did	0
Okay	0
Who has it in stick right now	0
Im not standing up here doing this for my own health	0
All right	0
Okay	0
Here Kayla that was yours for you homework	0
I already did that	0
Im glad youre back	0
So when you make up a rule make sure you say something  that s true	0
What the heck is going on	0
So keep up the good work everybody	0
He wants to give half of what he has to his brother	0
So it needs to be 95 degrees	0
What I would like you to do is take your hands off the material and look at me please	0
N minus 17	0
So Im going to steal this one	0
Neg negative two	0
Okay	0
So I would get rid of the 0	0
One	0
If theres four in the group youll be drawing three	0
Okay	0
You crossed  to five you made it four	0
What I wanted you to remember is that he had two rabbits and he bought four more	0
You know like	0
Once you do that then you have 35 adults to make sure that every kid has a chaperone and you dont have some kids that go missing and you need to add that to the 172 students	0
48 is the same as 12	0
Once you do that it is much easier to compare	0
You always go over before you go up	0
This is the third	0
I dont want it to make it look like I wrote six and a half	0
Lets say our fractions are 520 720 120 320 and 1920 put these in order from smallest to largest	0
Thursday is your first solo quiz in this class multiple choice	0
I love those	0
Not always easy to explain	0
Sweet	0
Alright the next four are going to go quick	0
Crew take your point to work with your tribe buddy	0
Place a one fourth piece next to one eighth piece	0
It says that in the problem	0
I call this angle A two	0
Those are really a little bit different	0
I know	0
The reason that I multiplied by four is because Im at 180	0
Okay	0
Last three minutes	0
I think its a little bit before for	0
Well I dont know if youre going to need them	0
Its disappointing	0
Somebodys template is on my desk	0
Okay	0
Thats okay	0
Shouldnt have writing during math but thats okay	0
So if we multiply the denominator by five we also have to multiply the numerator by five	0
That was fun to hear	0
Youre still drawing	0
Its the regular school kind	0
You go over then up	0
What were going to do right now is well look at two examples	0
Onefifth oneeighth	0
Guys come on I just gave you the common denominator for number two	0
Yes	0
Okay when you are done go to the rug please	0
Okay	0
But	0
Can we write it right here	0
Okay so you are going to write these as a mixed number fraction	0
Right	0
Okay so your final question that you had to solve was two tenths	0
What is the area	0
A relationship that shows how things are related	0
Thank you for the good questions so far	0
Okay	0
Theres one more step here	0
Person A come up with a fraction	0
Absolutely	0
if you can draw a vertical line that crosses your graph in multiple spots or twice at the same time I should say then you dont have a function	0
Guys dont second guess yourself	0
See what things we might need to work on a little bit	0
Wow	0
Im going to show this to you again	0
Miss pass the pen	0
So does division and multiplication	0
Yes	0
Then we ll hear from some others	0
Yes they	0
Goodbye Mr Chan	0
One two	0
This is your homework so lets do it now then you dont have homeworkSo what I want you to do after you write your first and last name on the sheet please is take a look at the two examples they give you	0
You can find out	0
Monday a test week	0
Okay	0
Thats I just said thats the N number of hotdogs	0
So four people in the family and stop sharing my screen	0
Im going to go back and put these houses back how they were originally	0
I might need to add to this but I might not	0
Both of them lost different Calories	0
One times one equals one	0
So now	0
He makes a problem up and he doesn t know the answer	0
Its popping	0
Can you write in your third	0
Okay	0
So we are going to look up word problems and make representations of those word problems using folded pieces of paper as fraction products	0
Ok I really would like someone to come up	0
triangle ABC is congruent to EFD  by side side side	0
Its now 15	0
You may uncap your markers and you may represent 310 as a decimal	0
Were going to talk a lot about Pythagorean triples today  and how those might help us	0
Okay	0
I  forgotten your	0
Im going to give this to Vanessa and Tierney and some of these have writing on them You wont notice	0
Turn your cameras on	0
Lets circle one group of threefourths here	0
Think about it	0
We are just about out of time but if you  want to maybe start it if you want to jot down an idea	0
Yeah	0
Good morning Erik	0
Yes	0
Okay so we did that through division	0
That s right	0
Its not like twos and tens	0
Gentlemen	0
So would that be the answer or would I put A B cubed	0
Okay	0
I think we should do it	0
Okay	0
All right	0
Maybe where I got it from	0
Grab me that book	0
Show me	0
What would be the only difference in the way you wrote the question or the numbers model	0
And then you just go down by one and a half	0
So here is the calculator Marcela	0
Okay	0
78 times 31	0
Okay so we have 21	0
Okay	0
Today is a big opportunity for one lucky student in this class	0
Two thousand minus you multiply this so this time on this side so okay	0
Sorry I started it without further instruction	0
Im going to zoom out	0
Okay were not going to talk so much about what the equations mean today	0
Okay	0
Thats far	0
who Im trying to think what I should have you do when youre finished	0
You know what	0
Thank  you you can sit down	0
So just have to keep h in the middle and then flip the order around as HBP	0
Now you have to calculate the length of the straw	0
Write down the first question	0
So Brenda got eight here	0
Lets do this Lets put this away	0
Multiply that out and see if you can find the rule for that	0
Alright so especially after that one your brain might be feeling like this right now	0
What pages do we do	0
I can fix that problem	0
Dont erase anything	0
Thank you	0
Did I take attendance	0
Oh you didnt have to	0
It has to do everything with our lesson but technically its just a fun little way to think of this to help you remember	0
You have to change your denominator	0
I dont think so	0
An irrelephant	0
Try to sketch it	0
Just complete them on Schoology	0
All right as always I am available to help	0
Oh whoa whoa you dont even know what Im going to ask you to do	0
You never finished	0
There is	0
Just mark your stop	0
Im going to give some goodies	0
Awesome	0
And I think we were on	0
I want to see how close and then fill in the table below	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Hm	0
Im still starving	0
Eight groups of nine	0
Your mode was two	0
So same slope as what we usShane for that one	0
Thats good	0
So I have 10 and 2540	0
Show me the last one	0
What I want you to do is I want you to get out your math journal and I want you to open it up to page No leave it out	0
Okay this is what it should look like	0
If you see right here	0
It was so funny I forgot to laugh	0
We know that the pizzeria is eight blocks away from the park entrance and then two blocks away	0
Number two on page 140	0
Clay you have to do this	0
Yep	0
Show your shoulder partner what you do and what your answer was and how you knew	0
I just said hands off them	0
Mmhmm	0
Make a new heading that says salad dressing	0
So Martin Clayl Georgia Sarah Missy and Matty and Ashley will you just join me quickly on the floor up here but I need one person from every table to come see me	0
It makes it a lot easier	0
One	0
Are we doing it together	0
Thats equal to negative 30 plus 80 thats also 50	0
This will thats the tricky saying right there	0
Then there are at least two pouches on both sides	0
Half	0
Okay and how about that would somebody	0
Im going to write it up on the board	0
Thats why Im just trying to  like how much you know	0
And thats it	0
We know theres 25 in there	0
There you go	0
What are those things for	0
Okay I just want you to see that and then Ramona make sure that youre writing in zero and zero not 02 for this one	0
we write the next one down we have 18 X	0
And this is the building block of all shape creation	0
Measure it you have a tape measure you have a ruler measure the maximum length that you can obtain	0
Ooh thats a good one	0
Youre going to have a yes or no answer but you have to prove it with your picture and your equation	0
57 57 57 57 that is 114 228 would be this number	0
So you take your slope you take your y intercept you put them into an equation	0
Okay	0
So uh in this case we just uh learned something about the meaning of the square root	0
Excellent	0
So I took away the information that was in this first column here	0
Youre writing in words	0
Thats wrong	0
The whole reason why we worked on these the problems that we have so far is to get really used to coordinates and then were going to actually apply it use some algebra stuff use some variables and see if we can figure out these sorts of problems that are maybe a little bit less specific than some of the other ones weve done	0
Nice	0
You tried that one it didn t  work	0
Thank you	0
So I want to want you to make it easier on yourself	0
Sorry	0
30 seconds reread the problem and explore why is the answer D	0
Excellent job	0
So you re saying four toppings is a tower 4 tall	0
Okay	0
So were gonna divide by two and youll get x equals two y	0
Okay	0
Because 14 13 12 11 10 9	0
Three minus four minus one	0
Now were going to exit this and then we are going to get to our map	0
Im going to open these up	0
Expanded form	0
And nothing turns five into twelve	0
Okay so what we say is no	0
So if for number one our divisor is per group this is the number of groups	0
Come on girls	0
Your answer makes sense	0
So Cassidy were going to do OJ to soda water	0
Great	0
Good work Alex	0
You can get down to the square root that you would take on that one	0
No not quite	0
Oh how much is it for the baskets	0
That s very interesting what Im hearing Audra say	0
Okay	0
That proves your argument that 13 doesnt work	0
One two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11	0
One	0
Now denominator	0
The German language is very Its intense	0
My old width I have to read it out of here  was four units	0
So let s see	0
So mine for what I just did says You have two cards out of fourteen cards correctly matched	0
No	0
Number five and six	0
Okay keep going	0
Go ahead and try it out and see what you get for your answer	0
Thank you	0
You need to be listening	0
I would say my argument is that I have five plus six or 11	0
No	0
Exactly	0
He put like	0
So the blue tick marks those sides are equal	0
to look really stupid	0
Youre going to make that into an improper fraction	0
Lets see if that would equal 34	0
Can I just test this one for you	0
Efficient	0
Thats not the answer	0
Yes so just work on that and Ill try to help you out	0
Because thats what we multiplied to get 96	0
There is an equal sign equal sign in each equation	0
It doesnt matter which way Im going to fold it the long way	0
And thats your new triangle	0
I make mistakes all the time	0
So unit fraction any fraction with a number one as its numerator	0
Im going to give you an ego box	0
Look at the shared screen right here	0
Muscle memory	0
So we just get to Y equals 180	0
And you will know you are successful when I can explain and prove how I solved fraction of problems	0
So everybody should know what the answer is here	0
So thanks Jeremiah	0
Alan is making a face	0
I would like so Luke you said you were done	0
And now lets multiply zero times seven is 01 times seven is seven	0
You stay with me Please	0
2 x 5 is 10	0
But the good news is that we can make a right triangle like this	0
All right	0
I want you to start in your notebook	0
What is our progress on	0
Wow	0
Right there	0
Negative 34	0
No different than what were doing today	0
Work with that fraction	0
Inside there was threefourths of a pizza	0
Your goal is to get 100	0
No no no no heres what Im gonna do	0
No please please please pick me Ms Davies	0
Thats okay	0
your group is done talking	0
And then calculating it again	0
Whats the difference between baking and cooking	0
Put it together and you make one trapezoid	0
On the next one	0
Sure	0
So here I have Step 1	0
Maggie we restarted the right place	0
Yes it still is	0
Its not calculated here	0
It goes into both of them	0
Y intercept always start with 0 x intercept always ends with zero	0
People were saying whats this 17 right here	0
In this one he starts off with 10 and he earns 400	0
Right next to Junior	0
Well I have an idea	0
Okay	0
Uhhuh	0
But what Im looking for my teachers to do is explain why we did it	0
All right	0
You guys had the more challenging one	0
The next one is this	0
Okay	0
Think about D like Daniel	0
If they start with a small blueprint and they have to scale it up to a reallife size then theyre going to have to use some of this math	0
Hope correct	0
Right	0
Im not sure why that desk is all the way over here	0
Okay	0
Laurie try to keep working just a wee bit longer	0
To go from H to S here you have to go over one up two	0
Now 3b 2d and then he has the Eg which is the example	0
Theres all kinds of different jumps adding together groups multiplying you could do all kinds of different things to get to 100 and then answer the questions on the back	0
Okay my friends I am assuming you are all back	0
Louise	0
So you have your equation y equals 3x minus five	0
So yeah	0
The first thing that I noticed that you did really well is you were very patient with your partner	0
So its going to be on this side of it	0
Yessiyess yes	0
50	0
Did you write that down	0
Is that each others answers that has one	0
Okay	0
Right	0
I am seeing if I  can see another one that I haven t seen	0
Now crew when youre dealing with a fraction we can call it a numerator and a denominator	0
Were pretty close	0
Okay youre asking questions youre comparing answers all of those things during your discussion	0
In Math were always looking for patterns rules and patterns	0
So if Amy writes The little duck ran across the street I am going to write The little duck ran across the street and if Amy wrote The little duck decided to stop and got hit by a car Im going to write The little duck decided to stop and got hit by a car	0
Thats what our lesson is today	0
We did it Investigation 1 but that was before break thats why this is a nice little reminder	0
Okay	0
Five different names for the number 1	0
Okay so Gage Duncan Blake and John	0
Yes but we need those too	0
Like how much would technically one lemon be if it was like this thing	0
Draw an arrow switch them and then youll use because were going to use that third one for Bobs friend Seth	0
Show us	0
Thirtysix we will start with that one	0
So round it up Teresa but yes its correct	0
Now here is what Im going to have you do	0
I go next door to my 100th spot	0
Lots of  there lots of understanding what the parts are and making sure that he took care of all of the different parts	0
And Im going to share my screen with you so I can draw	0
Okay	0
So those are all on the yellow plane	0
Whatever works best for you and the other person always works to do your work	0
So were going to add 12 and 2036 plus 20 and 2136	0
Now thats okay	0
Showdown	0
12345	0
I did	0
Okay	0
So this is right	0
But it is important to talk about what the y intercept actually means in a problem with the x intercept actually mean	0
Right	0
Hm	0
Too bad	0
And next do five plus one which equals six	0
Yes	0
So just want to see what youre able to do	0
Remember this is one of the themes of fourth grade in math	0
So Im going to play  here	0
Just so this will make	0
Yes I could have	0
Actually we say diagonals bisect angles	0
You dont have a squeegee	0
Good job thats really what our lesson is and that was correct but Im supposed to have you estimate whether the sums or differences are closest to zero 12 or 1	0
Thats my story	0
Absolutely	0
Im going to ask you the same question I asked them	0
Yes because X2Y2R from the Pythagorean theorem which you already know	0
I have three dice	0
Me and my partner thought it would be like the same unit rate of	0
Now the math message was a really good example of how this thousandths grid I know its hard to say can help you with expanded form if you do each place in a different color because as I heard and Drew and Jade paraphrasing tenths hundredths thousandths	0
Were going to assume that its the same	0
Its not proportional its only linear because it doesnt start at	0
And then seven times five is 35 11 times five is 55	0
The last two assignments Sam help me out here	0
You can use mine	0
All right so theres your area model and then we are done with this so um yeah the now were going to get your whiteboards out please and your dry erase markers	0
Bomp bomp	0
Can we work together	0
Wheres my notebook	0
Go back and add it for me	0
He had to have enough for five days	0
Notice that I have been kind of putting them over here as we were going okay	0
Its okay Gunnar	0
Margie Im ignoring your for a reason	0
All right	0
That was the median	0
No remainder	0
Wants us to shade 34 by 26	0
So you can you can write it however you want as long as the second one matches up	0
partners over there my friends	0
Pretend like its just another student in our classroom	0
All right and for your math classes today	0
Yesterday we looked at our ratio table	0
I saw nine circles and then I added nine plus nine nine plus nine nine plus nine and then that was 54	0
It is	0
All right	0
Okay can I get you  to  please	0
I want to see the drawing I want to see this part filled in I want to see an addition equation and I want to see a multiplication equation	0
Mike told him and he says Debs you were right on and he goes no Viola he was right on and that drives me crazy	0
Yes Zug is similar to Mug Wump	0
Okay asking that when its in some individual work time will help	0
I see four brave students five	0
Okay	0
Number two is up here	0
Somebody whispered it	0
Im so proud of you	0
Okay take notes on a separate sheet of paper then please	0
I always love teaching our twoday lessons because it involves so much thinking on your parts which makes me always so happy to watch you all think	0
Four shares is equal	0
Do you want to stay in here	0
Is that okay	0
So we have a we started with 540 in all and were dividing it by nine because thats how many boxes there are	0
What we have to do is find 35	0
So let me show you by something	0
You are solving problems 1 and 2 on your own and then you re talking with a partner	0
All of them	0
So 141 is divisible by three	0
So once I have my leg Im going to go ahead and draw that	0
All right heres some hard ones	0
Yes were just	0
Okay I want to see that youre putting in the effort before the last week of school not just when Times running out	0
You could put it  typically in equations but youre right	0
So you have this would be 01	0
You can do insert	0
I can see a little bit of your board	0
Okay	0
Please take a moment and do that step	0
And what Im looking for is like yes the slope is 45	0
So watch	0
Thats not enough for that ride	0
Perfect	0
So look at the top for activity two	0
So thats what youve learned	0
Mr Brown when we use the computer calculator we got 360 and when we did it on my calculator got to 359	0
15 was 5 35 is 15 5x3 is 15 so that everything thats coming out of this machine is 3 times bigger of what was coming out of this machine	0
So before we go any further theres a new vocabulary word there ratio	0
You guys can do rock paper scissors	0
Im going to just pull up the instructions	0
Double each number of the original pair	0
Because you were deciding whether it was going to be 0058 or 0059	0
Were going to add these in	0
Adam is mom home	0
Okay	0
Lets go back to that question I asked before	0
Do I have to draw pictures	0
Nobody got that part right	0
Thats the connection that you want to make	0
Okay take out your classwork exercise book	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
So x is the vertex of this angle thats the corner of the angle	0
Go	0
If one dies has one through six on it and the red die should have one through six on it	0
This is negative slope	0
I have a double	0
Lets choose a thicker pen width to go from this dot to this dot I know that I need to go down and over	0
Three claps for Eileen and her team	0
Well have some discussions about this and try it out	0
Because I see three minuses here and yet there are only three descending lines	0
There s something Im wondering about though Um  if they didnt win it in four games and	0
You need to pick up your pace	0
Mmhmm	0
Okay so let me get it up here	0
Im sorry	0
What did you name it	0
Same as the other one	0
Nine plus seven equals 16 thats how they got nine and then you took a whole of	0
So thats a lot of information	0
All right folks	0
Its not working	0
Yup	0
Because Im gonna have you do some proving	0
On your paper	0
It was 60 degrees	0
And then I went down three again to get to negative three and down to sorry over two to go to from two to four	0
The last time it took me 30 minutes	0
From minus six through eight	0
So thats our table	0
And x is before y in the alphabet as well	0
One two three	0
Youve got to go like that	0
Please step down on it	0
Looks like most of us are done	0
It would be groups	0
So that leaves us with number three number seven and number eight	0
Looks good	0
Heres what you are going to do now	0
Oh sorry	0
So therell be more time for that	0
In my math lessons	0
Then we can see it	0
Yes	0
And then when you are done with that you may play ST Math or you may play EM4 games	0
If your student wants to draw lines like this to separate out their place value that is a okay as well	0
Down the hall	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
You can also draw a picture to tell me how you know	0
If I want to get it done	0
Its right here	0
So the next slide on your Pear Deck nothing for you to write on this one	0
Yes but this was my first piece	0
Twelve and 84 hundredths	0
Were doing area so we have to use our formula for the area	0
Okay	0
Where are your math tools	0
So he is 58 inches tall	0
Get out one 13 piece and get out the 14 piece and see what will fit on top of both of them	0
So the question is record your work and then show how you decided where to place the cards to build the largest fraction	0
Correct	0
We are at	0
Lets go	0
So these work but another way to do it where you dont have to do as much work	0
So overall thats more and this is less	0
Put a zero here	0
All righty everybody	0
and then Im going to have you play the game	0
Into	0
Whatd they do	0
With the microphones I want to be able to hear your mathematical thinking	0
I think you just add three to it	0
This house right here this is one house with two people	0
It was so easy that you thought that that cant be the question Im asking	0
Yeah its times two or its you add it up twice right so its time two	0
Complete this rule	0
Okay were going to do a quick stretch break	0
So Ill give you guys about two minutes to think about that	0
If you have a couple of questions written on your whiteboard stand up please	0
You should be able to use the one and the three	0
If you do that	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Right	0
But chances are you were off task	0
Can you turn your microphone on	0
Okay	0
Clay Kayla lets just start with Clay and Kayla to start	0
So if you guys do remember partial sums basically what you do with partial sums is you do the addition	0
Because four plus one is five	0
yes	0
When youre trying to find the price of clothes or something	0
Im stuck	0
All right lets keep going	0
The first captain Im going to put these right here on this table the first captain Asher pretend that youre the first captain	0
Yes	0
Its kind of a hard  idea	0
Okay	0
Finish today strong just like were finishing this semester strong	0
You have supporters out here Sarah	0
Right	0
Im at my back table if you need any help	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
You cant run around	0
I can solve problems involving the subtraction of fractions and mixed numbers	0
Rylan	0
So this is three groups of 34 so its like 34  34  34 which would be 94 which we could say is the Finleye as when 4 goes into 9 two times so thats 2 14 and we can add the two of these together	0
Okay	0
And then were going to go by eight	0
Zero zero Xaxis and Yaxis are zero zero	0
Okay um so that is going to be like the challenge of math forever for all of us is explaining how you know	0
so this is just comparing all of the side lines	0
You covered your shapes with triangles	0
Its the only one in this pattern of 20 that will be touched by every single person	0
Right	0
I have a 50 and then I have an eight	0
Im only multiplying a partial of it	0
I dont see ten up there anywhere but okay	0
Im not sure	0
You need 80 more on top of this	0
Pick one	0
Like LeBron James is vertical	0
Thats exactly what they do	0
So if we just multiply this number by two and we just multiply this number by two	0
Mmhmm	0
And then what is it to the park entrance	0
Perfect	0
Well continue this later	0
Me I would like it better when you have something like that	0
I have logic puzzles and brain teasers and all kinds of fun stuff on the table if you want to do any  of that	0
I  know Mr Purdy wouldnt be so generous	0
Okay	0
So its a lot like what he did	0
Looks good	0
Kate Ill see if this is my number five	0
34 are red so 14 is white	0
And then I have two fifths left	0
This is orange juice	0
You want us to use partial quotients or just us division	0
Okay	0
We dont know how	0
Walker let other people think about what you are saying	0
Wait I like your idea of numbering	0
I think we all can learn from that	0
So measure of angle A OC	0
That you can think of this as going on and you can think of this as being made up of lots and lots of points	0
Im going to let you have your snack while your working	0
Did you get a cut here or is it	0
I agree with your answer I agree with  on your board but I have a question	0
Okay	0
So the homework assignments that are the most points are the Monday assignments and the practice tests	0
Yep	0
And actually Matt why dont you come over and work with them while were doing that	0
Yes	0
Yes	0
You guys I need you to be thinking stop doodling	0
Right	0
846 3	0
So Im going to fold it down	0
So right here we put our one smiley face	0
This is what we did last week and it was pretty easy for you guys to review	0
I need to make sure I see your work with these problems and you re just not writing down the answer	0
Until now we were not able to solve quadratic equations	0
One and onefourth	0
looking for hands	0
Okay so for this one rise over run	0
Yes	0
Then the away team wins one	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Than looking at oh my gosh thats 260	0
Lets get to work	0
Sorry	0
Count your points to make sure you have them all	0
Okay so I am going to put these friends into a breakout room	0
Let me try to adjust my there we go	0
on the partially filled tray	0
So this ones really tricky	0
Right	0
Awesome job	0
Boom	0
So maybe you can just sit with a pencil and a paper	0
Six	0
So the circle is not a function because it has an X that has two different ys that go along with it	0
Insert the slope	0
You may	0
Yes	0
Exactly	0
Well we have an extra 10 minutes because we read but thats all	0
Okay one minute	0
Prove it	0
You could say 13 wont work because 23 is bigger than a 12	0
And then A four times A four	0
Yes	0
Here Josh	0
Youre four groups of four	0
Now Judi will help kind of come to a conclusion	0
And then over here it is explained again and then you can continue on working	0
Okay for real were going to do pattern two this time	0
Oh awesome	0
The other thing here is that I doubt that you can do 15 times  Those are really good strategies	0
All right so we are going to our learning intention is I can use partial quotients division to divide whole numbers	0
Okay	0

Nice	0
Well sorry	0
Oh 24	0
So its one half plus one and one half plus one and one half is 3 halves	0
I was thinking something different but thats what I did	0
So two would be a factor	0
Then um the value of left side	0
Thank you sir	0
Theres a lot of graphing that is going to be kind of sneakily in these questions today	0

Because nine times four is 36 plus four equals the 40	0
We were just talking about maroon not that long ago	0
Okay	0
You go back and forth and talk about what method youre going to write about and how to do it	0
Alright so for this example we did vertical angles and the 180	0

Lets start at the beginning	0
Cadence and Charlie can do it together	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
And then you get to keep them	0
Alright put them up in the air	0
Okay	0
Do the mental math and the math method and then you can work on it	0
You should do 10 minus 18 because this would go from left to right	0
Its all right to look at in front of you	0
PUT IT DOWN	0
That is a good thought	0
Okay	0
Lets return to this question here	0
Crew remember that you have the opportunity to work with lots of people so look for lots of different people to work with today	0
Thats right thats right thats right	0
I think you have the idea	0
We have three six nine 12	0
We did 2X10X9 but really youre just multiplying all three together	0
If you need help let me know and I could come do it	0
One and one third is bigger than one and one fourth	0
The time in months	0
You can also do one and the colon four	0
You are going to coach you are not going to give coach the answer	0
If its possible do it that way	0

I know	0
Okay theres where you did it	0
Can I use it	0
And it is about to be 218	0
Okay	0
Thank you	0
Come back over	0
Triangles like this	0
12 plus 14 using your fraction circle pieces	0
He said the math	0
Okay now you can keep going	0
Okay	0
We talked about intercepts	0
Yes	0
Okay so  on the top	0
Estimate the sum of 12 plus 13 and then solve	0
So this is the four line	0
Thank you	0
and I will also say theres a lot of different things this graph could be showing you	0
Usual people I have to keep thinking about calling their names	0
And I showed my work on the number line as well	0
Wonderful because youre all be so good at determining prices	0
You probably already figured it out	0
Thats kind of what this is	0
So this becomes one and this becomes one and one times one is one	0
Okay	0
With your circles	0
Okay	0
not 90	0
No	0
Is 119	0
Thank you	0
I will round decimals up and down using a number line grid or rounding shortcuts	0
So if you do your slope formula X1 Y1	0
Okay thats what I was thinking	0

Last one	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
And then were going to go up here	0
Label them with a letter and an ordered pair	0
So you guys have all your answers now	0
See you can do it if you do it like this	0
Okay	0
Thats what I was just thinking	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Excellent job	0
No	0

That doesnt help Jeff understand	0
And hopefully at this point were kind of feeling really good about that	0
Tens hundred thousandths	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
recorder	0
Yes you did	0
Ask to switch this so you can see	0
Oh youre right	0
It doesnt matter either way	0
Because what thats going to do thats going to help you when I ask these questions about each of the equations	0
I hope youre not braining out	0
All right	0
So you guys already cut out your fraction pieces and equivalent fractions are fractions	0
On Monday youre going to have a math Excel assignment	0
Divisor the number the divisor is being divided by the number of ways something needs to be divided	0
I would like you to draw 10 boxes of candy	0
So either this is one or that is one	0
Okay	0
Those are all connected	0
Okay	0
So a right triangle has to have two edges	0
Youre getting it	0
This just happened to be Andreas but it doesnt matter it could have been Joys	0
If one yerts is six people try to keep your masks on	0
Youre welcome	0
You need tuna	0
Right we have proof and because of what we know about multiplication and addition we know that this answer is a fraction	0
So double check your picture to make sure that you are circling groups of two and a half	0
Okay number five were looking at the angles here	0
Stop trying to rush through things	0
Alright	0
You do 100 plus 90 divided by two	0
Im kind of putting you on the spot	0
If I was the oldest I would be happy but if I was the youngest or in the middle I wouldnt be so happy	0
Okay	0
two	0
So we know it works for that same intersected arc intercepted arc theorem works for 90 degrees works for acute angles	0
From your line	0
Youre attaching five zeros	0
Okay	0
Okay have a seat	0
All right	0
Thats not helping you learn	0
Oh would you do StMaP for me	0
I know that Gregory and Danielle are very fortunate   they have front row seats	0
Please come get your papers from me	0
But for this one it says take this shape and do this rule to it	0
And I also have a negative two a those are like terms which I can combine	0
Im going to give you some think time first	0
And then 3x means the slope is three	0
15 people bicycled from 30 to 59 minutes and 19 people bicycled from 60 to 119 minutes	0
Then the X is rides	0
Thank you for saying it out loud	0
Six	0
So if I divide each I dont know why this is not working into eights for me	0
I dont need that one I need this one	0
And then think about how much would they each get	0
We sure did didnt we	0
You can say Lynns is more orangey You can say Zyons is more orangey or you can say that they are the same	0
And then you have A C the smaller one right before they intersect at 40 degrees	0
Base is five the height is six	0
Hey Brian Im going to have you come sit right here inside because theres already four people there	0
Im sorry it was 33 hundredths	0
Talking about here	0
Okay awesome	0
Thank you	0

If you cant find an elbow up partner let me know	0
AlySa do you ever work with Ethan	0
Were going to come back to those though	0
Than your place value	0
That is understanding your multiplication facts and knowing them	0
No its gone	0
Sometimes its helpful for me if I put the number of counting by in my table	0
I know I can understand this this is a lot but this is going to be your strategies	0
Nice job	0
So we already answered that	0
All right	0
Dont lose them	0
Awesome move on	0
Those vocabulary words are vertical and horizontal	0
Hes 47 and a quarter inches tall	0
Okay	0
Thats mine thats mine	0
Okay	0
So youre going to have to be a little bit creative	0
Maybe two and side two is going to be this angle is this angle right here	0
Heres my class	0
Number 4	0
Sounds like a lot of different ways to interpret where theres just missing the logic	0
All right	0
I just want to talk a little bit about Phillips walking rate	0
I am not going to have you go over it you will turn it in	0
1323	0
Well come on up tell the camera	0
Like Georgia	0
So Ah lets see here	0
Thank you	0
Got it	0

Alright	0
One tenth	0
All of them	0
Less than and less than	0
Because you have to be able to tell me how it changed the shape of the object	0
What I would like for you to do is to use your number line to finish this model	0
Four twelfths	0
I could also do 48 plus 48 plus 48 plus 48 plus 48 but I really want to take a break soon so Im going to multiple instead because thats going to go a lot faster for me	0
Now I say if you have understood how you did this do the others	0
After you have created your sticky notes so that it looks like mine with a one two three and four these numbers correspond to stations one two three and four on the floor in the front of the room	0
Im going to give you one and I want to see how far you can get without my help	0
So now what I want to compare is actually were going to go a little bit smaller were going to go a little bit	0
Do it for a table now	0
Are you showing me in invisible ink	0
So we did On the X one	0
All right	0
His books doing the work	0
Were just doing tuna	0
Lets go to thirds	0
Lets go up to the first one and were going to write the points here as well	0
Thats fine	0
Dont exit out of it	0
Now similar to what we talked about earlier if you put 9 thats completely fine because it is a difference of nine but at the end you have to think about this is the decreasing line so its going to be negative	0
Party	0
You will need more practice	0
Yeah	0
No	0
Its 835 there superstar	0
Yes we are	0
No here afterwards give it another name also if there this is also a hypotenuse	0
The place on the place value chart its in	0
Yes	0
You and your partner were supposed to work on the back one	0
I dont think I did it right	0
Thats where it crosses the y axis	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
All right our lollipop math this morning was very similar to our lollipop math yesterday	0
Were tripling the second coordinate	0
All right	0
Yes	0
Just warming up our math brains	0
We have only one absentee	0
Good	0
Okay	0
My friends may work	0
I end up with 13	0
You guys I need you to work with your partners and have do partnerships	0
Yesterday the purple sheet which was box and whisker practice	0
y is 110 so 110 Minus 40 That is 70	0
Three sixteenths	0
Especially those of you that are doing grade level and above work which most of you are	0
When you say way easier thats what we mean by efficient	0
And the rise is actually dropping by two and youre run is three	0
So you got six	0
got two more slides to go keep up the good work everybody	0
Look at your own	0
Mmhmm	0
I was trying to see if Raul would get that	0
This one R V U	0
Ill think of a question that weve already covered be it geography math science reading and ask students to answer that	0
OK you might want to go	0
Can I erase this	0
They are not the same animal at all so thats like the common denominators	0
I think those are the vocabulary words that you need to know for what were doing	0
youre like	0
Or and and	0
Um lets say equation two	0
so were doing	0
Without that number you cant do a thinking box	0
This ones number two	0
Then you go Calculate	0
These ordered pairs represent ages	0
I ve heard a different one	0
Its okay to not write all the lines of the mathematical expression	0
All right	0
Ok	0
Well one between one and three is two between three and five is two between five and seven is two and between seven and nine is two	0
So Evie you kind of you muted right in the middle of your answer	0
But I should see some work from everybody	0
Yes	0
Right	0
Because you are what	0
Its not like its not like a quadrilateral	0
Or five groups of seven	0
So nine divided by three is three	0
Im very sad we dont get to go see the kindergarten play	0
Then thats square root three over two	0
Volume  of a sphere is 36000 Pi meters	0
You can also have degrees that are like more than a full circle	0
One two three four	0
Thats interesting	0
Were going to order from least to greatest	0
Once youre done you need to check with me	0
Area equals length times width	0
Fourths	0
Or you could do it the other way around with three reds	0
I m proving it to you	0
X Y table	0
Yak	0
And then and then you just have some time to work today	0
You guys are doing really good with these patterns	0
Okay everybody voices off one more time for me voices off in three two one	0
Let s fill in these things at the bottom if you have it already	0
And I made it so that theres enough space for it to be perfect all the way there	0
We decomposed	0
Keep your desk	0
Lets go to another set	0
We cant really move the houses	0
Two one and zero	0
So homestretch everybody	0
Okay	0
You didnt say the facts	0
Sweet	0
Thats good	0
You could do two	0
Alex always put the number first	0
Lets start with a visual	0
You need to follow directions	0
Okay	0
So this is Mr	0
Is that right	0
And this is important	0
Were taking the dots	0
Good	0
All right people let me put up the code for you	0
You broke it	0
Cool	0
Okay so lets so lets just do a round of this just to remind you	0
Yeah absolutely	0
can I see your thing	0
Okay	0
We need to label this	0
If you take these two  that would be one half	0
All right	0
Okay	0
I am allowed to carry her into the church for the baptism	0
3	0
One half plus three eighths	0
The run in between these is one so the run is one and then I put the equation up here for all of them but slope is rise over run	0
Thats right	0
Abel you need to focus buddy	0
And were going to split this up into seven eights because thats our total so were going to start with zero and then one eighth two eighths three eighths four eighths five eighths six eighths theres seven eighths and you can stop at seven eighths	0
Right	0
SS right help your table mate if they dont get it	0
So we are doing a 407 using models to multiply decimal numbers partially philly fun	0
Im going to put a couple of links in the chat	0
And down here Michelle Michelle and Erin think there is  going to be more	0
These are tick marks	0
Yeah	0
The table below so heres an example for you	0
Uh lets see	0
Right	0
If you dont have the Y equals its technically not an equation	0
For chapstick	0
I tried	0
So now if they are changing the coordinates by six each of these should match	0
I want to see everybody making two histograms right now	0
Okay were looking pretty good so far	0
Yes	0
10 to the power of three	0
Thats what question number three is asking from you	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Thanks for letting me know	0
Im at 175	0
I wont look too soon from far away I might see a name that looks like my and I need to be sure	0
I Dont want to be in a breakout room	0
She developed a rule to help her fix the drawing Helenas rule	0
Diana this was your SAT	0
This point negative five negative three	0
And then we multiplied that times four so I want you to notice how Im writing this	0
Hmm	0
Rate yourself on inequalities	0
Dont mess with what I just showed you here	0
I would like you to do a lot more just the same as I want you to do the first at the bottom	0
Lets see	0
So were just going to go one two and a half	0
As Ive said from since Monday since the beginning of the year really we need to memorize our factors	0
Okay	0
Write down what you think yes or no	0
And then but the same height	0
You could say for every  lets do for every two mice	0
Then do the trading with the two first	0
Yeah	0
Go this way	0
It is a quotient	0
We still have the five hanging on there and we get that	0
So when we say carton its kind of like saying a box	0
Think about what example I gave you	0
Right so now we need to exit that and I need to go over here	0
Okay	0
Youre going to have to create your own value ordered or ordered value bar charts tomorrow	0
You understand like why you would eliminate how that eliminates	0
Right	0
2 to the 3rd power	0
That one half is one third bigger than one third	0
All of  you disagree with the argument of calling the red one quarter  when you called the yellow and green together one	0
Hm	0
Im in Team 2 so were doing a comparison	0
The same rules apply here that applied when we were doing the fractions	0
Indigo thank you for switching seats to give your partner your full attention	0
Yeah	0
No	0
So the two the value of the 2 is 2 million	0
Okay um Im going to stop sharing this for just a second	0
Thats perfect then	0
Were going to start with	0
on my stuff	0
Youre on the right track	0
Oh Noelles number four	0
Im just taking everything out the bag	0
So I multiply the three by two	0
Cyrus said 32	0
All right example two	0
I dont either	0
Make sure you have a picture not a ratio table yet	0
Okay were looking pretty good	0
If its helpful for you to think of 20 divided by four you can do that	0
Therefore you should never use addition addition to calculate this question	0
This one is written in six and two	0
Go	0
Okay I think I used up no thats right because then one of the six had both shades in it	0
Heres the thing exactly What our next step is and whats going to go inside of it	0
Okay Jayden here we go	0
When we have categorical data we cannot find a mean because were not calculating numbers to find a number that would represent this	0
Okay	0
You would have 54 square feet of garden	0
Miss Tam okay	0
Well good morning	0
Thats why we have this symbol right here	0
I just need to take attendance	0
Now you have to finish the calculation Marc	0
So move this over to here	0
All right so we have a new lesson in here its called ordering fractions	0
Now obviously there would be other things	0
Thats the algorithm numerators and denominators	0
Yeah that totally works	0
Because this fraction is the same value as this fraction is the same value as this fraction	0
Yeah	0
Oh my God they have  on then	0
So we added 180 and 24 together to get 204	0
So there are two cups in a pint	0
When youre doing homework and youll have to do multiplication	0
Okay	0
A raised to the fifth power	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
All right	0
Find another name for	0
David is serious	0
If you go one step to the right	0
His shortest time was that he stood up for zero seconds he didnt even get on the surf board	0
All right	0
Does it have to be with ratios	0
Go	0
All right people so Im going to let you go	0
These ones	0
You multiply and multiply	0
You can have a ratio of 25 to one if you want or	0
Now you can solve such a problem by yourselves in your notebook and again with the values	0
Okay	0
But we really mean two children  fishing at a little dock not out in the ocean somewhere where  we expect the fish to be smaller but youre right youre  absolutely right Michael it could be	0
Look at the question	0
Left is a piece that we will mark with yellow color	0
Well leave you alone	0
Now if a family here in the text book the name is Fuchs	0
I know because if youre multiplying by two its going to be two times as large	0
Why did we do that	0
Okay so 66 we know is the same as one whole	0
He means that	0
Part E	0
If you call the blue rod nine then you could say then the white rod  is one pink rod is four yellow rod is five and you proved five plus  four is nine	0
I want you to think about a strategy you can use to solve this	0
12 and 35100 is less than 12 and 410	0
Very good	0
The only other way we could talk about it is if we did the hundredths if we were adding If we left the whole numbers I dont know	0
These are all equivalent to three sevenths	0
This piece of paper to the side	0
Well clearly you were measured wrong	0
Two	0
Is that	0
Now everybody is starting to second guess themselves	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Lets take a look at the string of operations	0
Lesson four	0
Thats a limited supply for the whole year especially if youve already had one or two	0
Mason and Zachary can you get sanitizer	0
If I were to expand this okay if I was going to expand that that would be A times B times B times B	0
And ordered pair	0
Eight divided by two	0
Use the line to determine the ages of Lilith and Noah at various points in their lives	0
one and itself	0
For homework I just want you to um do down to the bottom of the page down to number four	0
So the second one is definitely harder and lets see	0
On your whiteboards boys and girls	0
We are going to quickly go back and were going to look at our learning intention	0
You guys complain about reading for 30 minutes	0
So the rule is double each number of the original pair	0
Okay everybodys got a partner	0
Okay  were just looking at this six right here	0
Yeah	0
You could represent it on a number line	0
Here is what I am noticing	0
I thought matg boxes ibauidble	0
So	0
132	0
Lets go check out Hadleys	0
Thats how I know youre ready	0
And then Id like you to write an x two y two because thats part of the second point	0
Get one and one fifth compared to some people getting one  and one quarter and  some people getting one and one ninth	0
Gentlemen stand up	0
Awesome	0
Okay so when I went back and asked Charlotte and Adam first of all how they were going to solve this they had written two thirds of nine	0
There you go Robert	0
Im seeing some numbers	0
Yes	0
So now that I told you that much lets think about it	0
Good thing I talk a lot	0
Let me know if you want to review stuff for the test	0
Excellent	0
So now were going to go into writing	0
You guys were trying to do something really complicated and that was a good try	0
You could also say maybe half	0
Michael because right now Im sharing my board with the math	0
Step back for a second	0
Im going to give you a few more minutes	0
I would like a volunteer who can read the first two paragraphs out loud of this story or this information	0
Okay	0
Mm hm	0
Now I would like you to practice a little on these techniques because you will notice	0
If you go one step to the right then you have to go three steps down to get back on the line	0
No I dont like pictures	0
All right	0
Uhm	0
One person two people in Ollies house	0
If you can	0
All right	0
Okay	0
The next step 30 x 30	0
I hope you actually learned five units	0
Well no	0
Now heres the thing I dont see six hexagons	0
Let me go back	0
Im not understanding how you knew how to get that number	0
Why is this not working for me	0
That means I was only with them three days that week	0
Thank you	0
Then it says  name five multiples of seven and five multiples of nine	0
Last one	0
Awesome	0
That way you can see it very clearly	0
Over here	0
Very good	0
I cant add 34 and 16 because they dont have the same denominator	0
But Brians a quick study	0
Either one of those would work but I do think that one is a little bit high	0
Hands or thumbs	0
Okay	0
Im going to be doing that next unit and its not easy to teach division trust me	0
Well not neceStudentsarily	0
Awesome	0
So really nice	0
Actually you guys need to look up here for the math methods	0
Think of a fraction of interpret the fraction as division	0
Okay	0
Show	0
Harriette call someone else to do the next step	0
Yes Andrea did a great job using her math vocabulary and making it really clear to the reader about why this would work	0
I got that from	0
We re going to graph it	0
Yeah	0
And then well start filling in the information that we know	0
Right	0
Focus straight please	0
Then arent you supposed to take two 225 plus 64	0
If you have finished with the box put it back over there box scissors	0
Yeah you could use a calculator	0
Oh onetwo	0
Four	0
Uhm then okay	0
but that didnt work out so then I used my fraction circle and I used my circles to  and I figured out that five of them	0
Were is Christianne	0
That is what you like to do	0
Okay	0
Fractions numerator denominator	0
It depends if it works if they draw the same triangle as youve got it works	0
So your drawing is going to look something like that	0
So every time the figure number goes up by one oops sorry about that up by one by one by one the number of squares in the diagram goes up by four	0
Almost everybody jumped right to the right answer on this one	0
My mind is	0
Yup	0
The area model is something you will get and understand or its something thats going to be a little confusing	0
The post office	0
D would be 100	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Lets get my bodies in the way	0
Yeah	0
And Oops thats not what I wanted	0
Every time if we were to draw that every single time that  might get kind of hard because you guys I erase it because I have a whiteboard but you cant you cant always erase it	0
Right	0
Russell pull your chair up do your job	0
A rightangled side	0
All right	0
So write that	0
Its like I planned that but I totally didnt	0
The number of squares goes up by four for each figure	0
Lots of different strategies	0
Thank you for working with me	0
Okay open your eyes	0
Two and one hundred	0
I put it last time	0
I need to do the math myself	0
Plus one is seven	0
Okay	0
Oh so so lets lets just talk about those rules before you talk to your partner	0
So our slope for this problem is three	0
Okay so were going to talk about the graph first	0
Both of them	0
Go to your next set of data	0
After we do this activity I want you to keep in mind I can explain why I think it represents a situation I can paraphrase my partner	0
What that looks like is this goes from 81 to 162 5 1 to 10 2	0
Now Alberts Egg Emporium sells eggs in cartons of onehalf dozen	0
So 50 times 99 is 4500	0
Yeah	0
Be prepared to explain your thinking to the class	0
Wait	0
where a lot of you messed up	0
Five and six	0
So that one didnt make a ton of sense	0
They will take advantage of you	0
So if we look at the data thank you sir	0
But as always with Mr	0
I am going to start them in like three minutes	0
Well dont come talk to me	0
Heres Jordans	0
Like that	0
I took a look at some of the students work and I congratulate some of you on a good job	0
So 150 is too high	0
You re both talking	0
So its three and four sevenths	0
I dont know	0
Let s see if you can find one that I haven t  seen yet	0
Mmhmm	0
and then youll be able to tell me where to stop	0
We are going to run in place	0
Its all about finding a strategy that works	0
And youre doing factors	0
Those two dots prove that identity	0
Okay put them in the category that you believe they best fit in	0
Great	0
Awesome	0
And it came	0
Oops	0
No decimal  approximations	0
Investigation 12	0
Okay	0
Okay now lets put this all together in an equation	0
You got it	0
Okay	0
Youre going to do this	0
Lionel when you were just talking about that You said 90 and nine	0
So for Andre he paid 141 for nine tickets	0
So we have our ratio table drawed out	0
Once your planner is filled out you may start working on either one of those assignments	0
Where else do we revise things in our life	0
Okay	0
Yes but  isnt here yet	0
He said	0
Now the one idea that we have on the table that I wish  we would explore before we hear all the new ideas is this  one here	0
But I could do seven	0
Linear and it has a constant proportion	0
This is what we are left with	0
A couple of great questions	0
Okay	0
How come you crumpled it up	0
All right Ace its time get your breakfast finish up get it thrown away so you can do some math here	0
we dont have the roll radius but we have the slant length	0
Dont draw random squiggly lines	0
So that you can vary	0
Write an example	0
Uhum	0
you going to grab homework	0
Instead of	0
Ill look at it in a second does that sound good	0
We have a 60 degree angle	0
Easy	0
I love how she showed what actually could work	0
Theres the fact that its 180 degrees	0
Okay	0
For question number six right here okay reflect number five across the line equals X	0
Matt	0
in size because we are	0
All right	0
Okay	0
Okay so you should actually circle yes on this	0
And its weird because I know	0
Park entrance to the pizzeria	0
Shes going to keep 12	0
We would only know how big our unit was if one said one foot one centimeter one inch	0
but to be assimilated as a part of daily thought and brought again and again before the mind with ever renewed encouragement	0
Three plus X	0
That works	0
but I got to save you up for my	0
Im old	0
I raised my hand for the 158 cups of water	0
Oh please	0
Negative 50	0
Thats just another example of a variable expression	0
And notice how its each hour thats really each one hour	0
If you need to try  to figure out these bows the lengths of these bows you  might not at first want to cut up your ribbon	0
Listen up	0
So its a real hassle	0
So Mrs Dobson I dont know if I mentioned that Mrs Dobson teaches 4th grade and she would like to do this problem with her 4th graders	0
I like your idea of rounding to the nearest 100	0
I also added E and the value of a diameter as a fraction which is not common	0
But of course it is not so clear to just write down it is	0
No	0
There it is	0
How come I dont see a bunch of pictures	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Right in your road	0
All right	0
Go	0
Im going to ask you the same thing	0
So this is where I get a lot of questions on how do you do six cubed in a calculator	0
Should I write this whole thing here	0
Hmmm probably this one lets see just a second	0
You took the area formula and you replaced what you knew	0
I did	0
What is the	0
And so you can get started on your homework page seven and eight	0
Lets move on to other stuff	0
It s one that you can t divide	0
1 out of 5	0
Okay	0
They want us to find fractions equivalent to one half	0
And I didnt expect you to but now you understand and Isaiah I hope youre planning on memorizing those two because you just need to know them	0
Looks perfect	0
Shes gonna be gone for five days	0
Right now	0
All right so these lines Im just going to write the parallel piece on there	0
Yes you do	0
Tell me right away what is one of the numbers that will work	0
And then she said Well I want to take 110 right here	0
What fits and lets proceed this way what does certainly not fit	0
The nearest whole number would be four	0
Thank you	0
What page is this on	0
Theyre both over two up one	0
You didnt have to solve it	0
Okay	0
Yes dont forget you have lots of ways	0
Tell me what you did	0
What is	0
And the first part steps one and two each person in the group on the piece of paper on the back here it says your triangle	0
You got it	0
All four	0
Wait wait	0
Today Ive asked you to create number sentences involving our parts	0
Me you	0
And because I know that I cant do anything division wise to make it come out easy	0
All right thank you friends	0
Ms Rossi Get a pencil and you can use this page	0
Its worth five points four of the five questions we talked about how to do today one of them function notation we did not talk about how to do today	0
How many are red	0
That goes with two different answers	0
Just a second	0
No no no no	0
How long will it take Andre and Han to move all 72 boxes	0
You dont have to use the triples if you know the Pythagorean Theorem its just a shortcut	0
The first one was yes right	0
30 minutes	0
I made a mistake	0
So for the first one  it was fivethirds and you got one in twofifths	0
Okay	0
So we have to choose another way of doing it	0
You need to go back and look at that	0
Strategy do I want to solve	0
And that s a  mathematical proof	0
Okay friends	0
Around here	0
Okay your last one	0
So Cadence and Franc just gave us our problem that we are going to solve using the area model	0
Franc they do not go in the trash	0
Yes	0
Well I think I would like to look at a figure and check it	0
A fifth of 15 is 3 times 15 is	0
And it was one two three four five six seven eight 11 12 13	0
So thats going to be a common number today	0
Wait	0
Heres my favorite thing	0
You can agree disagree or have a question	0
Cotangent of 2 is x   y	0
That area model does not make sense to Annie	0
So its worth remembering	0
Okay	0
Three	0
I took this and I set it up trying to not get it to fall down but there we go	0
Jake Im going to give you a minute to work on it then were going to come back to you	0
We have a sixth of something and threefourths	0
I think its two tenths	0
The sentence youre going to say is  I got this answer because I got this because On your manage math if you are the one you are speaking first	0
Thats awesome	0
this white part	0
Do you put down here one to 24	0
Have a wonderful day	0
I thought that it was on page 138 but its not	0
Its now 930	0
Good	0
I proved it with my picture or prove it with our fraction	0
Leave it as three X	0
Be ready to share with your class there were only two	0
Okay	0
So we have a recipe	0
thats okay	0
Okay you have to do a whole step before you ever get to that point	0
Just because you come in late doesnt mean you dont have to get started my dear	0
So Im actually going to take away the plus zero its just four n Okay	0
We take the total and then breaking up	0
tinies tinies tinies tinies tinies	0
One at a time	0
You will know youre successful today when you can answer problems one and two on page 191	0
It is can you do it	0
Okay so lets look at the pieces	0
We can maybe do one two three four stages if its needed	0
Right	0
Once you have all the pieces you need once you have nine times three once you have the 27 pieces then youre dividing them into groups that are the size of two	0
I dont but I have an extra	0
4	0
1 2 3 4 so thats three thirds	0
This is a review	0
Oh I think this is a new clue	0
Okay	0
They wanted you to determine the height of all three of those monkeys put together	0
Okay	0
Theyre going to call down for a reason	0
Yes	0
So you can test it using all of these values	0
Stop arguing stop touching stop arguing	0
We add one from	0
That doesnt tell us its the greatest common factor	0
Dont worry Zach and Julia	0
You got it	0
To add on that I know that its more than one because 12 and 58 is more than 12 of an 88 so 12 plus 18 is more than a 12 is more than one its	0
Correct	0
Whats the answer gonna look like	0
Kameron your nose	0
7 34 7 7	0
I was about to say I was a little confused	0
Okay so the bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces and vice versa	0
Your job is to do these two problems	0
Okay stop	0
Not as easy it may be as it appears	0
Why dont you ever see elephants hiding in trees	0
Next one	0
Okay	0
Okay so Julia lets look at yours	0
So look at mine	0
What that means is this	0
For all seven	0
Uhoh	0
90 zero times is still zero	0
And you can do those little jumps of two thirds to get up to this next point	0
shell give you a little container for it	0
10 times as much	0
Now our rule is that we are going to add something or take away something	0
Can you tell us more about what it is	0
But you do have to choose one	0
So	0
Okay and then 12	0
Okay	0
47 and three tickets those are both less	0
Dont start with the number sentence	0
Let s see what we do here let s try it	0
This x2 will cancel out with that x2	0
What do they do at a paint store	0
Dividing	0
No	0
Because it says she ate 12 of 22 carrots	0
Now what we have to do here is make a line plot of the data that includes a title and correct labels	0
Watch please	0
So if I share all of these fractions equal the same thing	0
Okay	0
Do you like to divide more or multiply more	0
Then it goes to the next one	0
Its how steep the line is	0
Perfect	0
Im listening to this and youre saying nothing but staring at the board	0
Youve got 1000 in your account	0
no	0
I appreciate that	0
Try to write it	0
Talk as you do so	0
Well start here  very	0
Austin you are with John	0
Okay	0
Has anybody ever heard of this word before whether its in mathematics or life	0
Mia and Sarah	0
You could have gone from 200 to 40 and divided by 5	0
Thats a lot of cookies	0
So I have equal sides here here	0
I need 3 equivalent fractions yes	0
So read up on strategies	0
Im just coming through	0
You should write that down in your note catcher	0
Good job	0
Okay	0
I just told you you could have gotten more out of it	0
Can I stick it on this one is not where it needs to be	0
Yes	0
Oh Michael we need to pay attention	0
The difficulty is that when I inscribe the square compared to how simple it is here one side  equals the diameter	0
Griffin youre ready	0
Okay	0
Im telling you it works but Im also telling you we cant use it	0
These problems will be a bit more difficult	0
We have to visualize the rest of it being in there	0
So now I have five fifths plus seven or plus two fifths	0
No	0
If you will recycle make sure all pencils pens markers are picked up off the ground	0
Explain it	0
So	0
Thats a good one Kevin	0
Where are your whiteboards	0
Ok for the number name of this	0
So I would like you all to put your math away	0
You see it is	0
It is probably the most important	0
Let me show you something	0
Equal to greater than less than	0
Three and four	0
1130 PM	0
Val types of situations equal groups conversations area volume comparisons	0
Now lets compare the points	0
Take the first calculation	0
Give me a number	0
Thank you	0
Nothing out of the ordinary	0
Thats kind of confusing	0
Im so sorry	0
Lets change this fraction	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
So this in order for them to be equal this would have to be foursixths	0
Thats good	0
Five times one is five plus four is nine	0
Nice	0
You could say it has to be everything from negative infinity up to three the union of three up to five and the union of five up to infinity	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
So when you see cost per bottle that should be like Oh the price for one of something	0
Anyways	0
So now we have three	0
Okay so today you are going to develop and apply rules to enlarge	0
Go ahead and pass it to whomever you d like	0
So I could say maybe 112s or  something like that	0
That doesnt matter	0
So when you divide by two write a space here divided by two divided by two well get X equals 75	0
That means seven questions for this one	0
It goes in order	0
Think about how many make one whole	0
Do we cut them along the lines	0
And then and then we have	0
Yes	0
Come on start working	0
Then you have	0
Clay you need to have all the concept	0
Are those yours	0
You gave them some horns	0
But I think you all have an idea of how your thinking might need to change for the second one	0
So the y intercept is zero negative four	0
Students you may start okay	0
Round 882 and 186 thousandths to the nearest hundredth	0
Youre not taking a whole 34	0
No	0
Okay so x y and B	0
What if I now gave you all the same clothes but I  also gave you another pair of jeans	0
Brian is like	0
Go with that	0
So please start working on 229 measuring capacity	0
Thats the part that was missing	0
You do fourths first	0
All right	0
A couple of things to get started for today	0
With this side	0
You are writing an expression	0
So crew you just drew a diagram you just wrote out a number sentence to represent what you did and then you identified whats the size of the group and whats the number of the groups	0
You can put a purple up there too	0
Okay	0
Sorry I tripped on the cord	0
Four and three	0
This is a fraction of	0
I dont need the Hunter	0
Its raining cats	0
Yeah we could	0
So your slope is three	0
So I showed two and three fourths	0
He added these two and then he took the perimeter minus both of those sides and he had 18 left	0
Oh	0
I can discuss other students rules and pictures on the coordinate grid and revise my work	0
Did somebody move it	0
right there	0
So you need to fix what she did	0
The rest of you can I your eyes this way and Im going to be pairing you up with a partner that I think youre going to work really well with okay that youre going to do the same  try it and then you look at it and just guess you might revise your thinking	0
We started  with seven meters	0
Start at that point to make sure that the new one you draw is joined on to the old one rather than separate	0
Okay	0
Okay so everybody else	0
Bless you	0
We need to find a common denominator so were going to multiple these together	0
Okay	0
Ok um you think there are others ok	0
So when it says What two whole numbers	0
We lastly think the X coordinate will be on 24 and our Y coordinate will be 30	0
To make our sum	0
You and your partner have to discuss	0
Groups so you really should have told me four to eight because remember with ratio the order is important	0
Okay	0
I need you to do number four	0
Okay so Im going to write 41 right here above pq	0
Now lets see if we have some more student work	0
Erik We want thirds and fourths not tens	0
Now were all of these fairly equal	0
Sorry Cole	0
Thats interesting	0
Two	0
Same points but flipped	0
Now Im going to make equal groups	0
You put the Y first then	0
May I come up to the board	0
Uhm	0
If youre all okay with that we got a long way to go before we understand math in this class room	0
So 13 times 2 is the same thing as 13 plus 13	0
35 is less than one	0
But the y intercept notice its like right there	0
No zeros	0
I m actually going to just take a volunteer and what I want you to do is share what you ve talked about with your group	0
But if you cant do it then take a piece of scratch paper and write it all out on it	0
Oh theyre right there	0
Okay so you guys know I love to do this all the time but were going to estimate this first	0
Sure	0
And he had one group of 18 plus another group of 18 plus another group of 18	0
Our first problem is an addition problem	0
This is her rule	0
Okay	0
This is all Im going to do	0
Can you wait	0
What does that mean	0
Um you know we were talking  about sharing things that people like and I was talking to um  Tom earlier and I was talking to Amy	0
Four	0
Youre absolutely right that they had different sized pieces	0
Pull up your mask	0
All right lets see who the lucky winner is	0
So the number that were trying to hit is 40	0
Im only missing one  piece	0
Give me a round of applause	0
So you see it is continually doubling	0
Hes another T not me	0
Okay	0
Its not me	0
And youre going to look along the very top	0
Im doing	0
Awesome	0
So one time 30 is 30 and six times 30 is 180	0
I dont get that part	0
were not playing until after everybodys done their job	0
Awesome awesome job of calling me out on that guys	0
Yes	0
So really your question would have boiled down to divide 111000 in the ratio one to one	0
Zero	0
Looks good	0
Round 99 and twelve hundredths to the nearest tenth	0
TRUE	0
Could you be so kind as to check if	0
Yeah cause this would be one sixth those two together	0
Lets take five minutes to graph those points please	0
Ill explain it as we move forward	0
So we dont know anything else about it	0
And you could just write Forest Preserve	0
We talked about this yesterday	0
Oh my goodness	0
So if you remember	0
Weve got our Yintercept	0
Go	0
Wheres my page 397	0
Thats not what Im going for	0
Thats great	0
The entire page	0
Okay what I heard Anthony just say is I dont know how to add up the fractions	0
Ha yeah	0
Which is 20	0
Yeah because a 40th is smaller so lets change our answer and lets say 110 and 16 oh no sorry 110 and 38	0
All right how many  like sixteen games you know like the fiTeachert one	0
Lets just make it be a X32x9	0
Someone okay	0
The one on the left is correct	0
Because its showing you that with with On with Online Flix and Mail Flix you still have to pay the monthly fee even though youre not buying any movies	0
I want you to try and use the word for every in your statement	0
So the last thing I want to say is this	0
You guys better have more on your board beside somebodys name	0
Okay	0
No partial sums	0
Okay and when we graph it on the next slide were going to be able to answer that question	0
It doesnt matter	0
The only time Im going to use the bigger denominator and smaller pieces is when the numerators are the same but if the denominators are the same then I can just say okay which ones bigger	0
I don t see that sixty there	0
Some of you did it by  counting	0
Sir	0
Koolaid was invented	0
Simplify that	0
As soon as you have this written down put your pencils down and then its time to actually try this	0
Now if you remember from our first school today its to be able to model this with a diagram and were going to use a ratio table	0
Well what I dont understand youve  got a solution in X there	0
Now I get to set up my wrestling matches and Ill show you this part in minute how I know its four but Im going to have four different matches	0
Okay	0
So thats two six	0
Youre doing it with this number	0
All right so my expectation is if you are not if you dont all agree then you need to do some talking	0
Mmm hmm	0
Oh now its okay	0
Threefourths of a bag of eight carrot	0
the points of view represented in this article will be discussed through their similarities and differences	0
Okay cuz this just goes right through the middle of that box this is going to be 55	0
Of this side	0
So onethird is the same thing as 412	0
How about a ruler would that help	0
Okay	0
Okay stop right there	0
Numerators small then basically you have a pretty small number	0
Lets get ready to go through our stuff for today	0
Its going to be one of you geniuses	0
One more youre going to round to the nearest thousandths on your own	0
Well you can write it like four tenths is less than 56 hundredths	0
Okay	0
And remember when we have two variables next to each other theyre being multiplied	0
There are many multiple steps and this one is in the fourth grade	0
Cool	0
I like how theyre walking reEy quietly	0
Thank you  youre absolutely right	0
Since four times two is eight I just	0
Whos your partner	0
Do two and four five and seven	0
You can	0
The only one whos right is the one who said its twofourths	0
Thats next Friday	0
Maybe this is the place we should stop because we re  running out of time	0
Lets see	0
Quiet now	0
Okay	0
And then you connect here and here	0
Thats what it sounded like you had asked	0
No	0
If you choose the detailed writing like here the danger of copying is not far away	0
Get it up here broken apart	0
I wonder how long its been over there	0
You had 77 apples and you packed them into boxes	0
Wow	0
You have got to be careful about those	0
And your book	0
Well I realized that it was wrong to me  because that wasnt cool	0
Is it two  things the same and two things different	0
Okay heres the heres the results	0
For the rule	0
Now what you want to do is put it down so that Michael can get his camera set	0
If things are similar lets use red for these	0
Five six seven eight	0
They probably still have you muted	0
Okay	0
And I want to show you one other thing before we actually answer the rest of them	0
And its not going to be fun but if you will memorize your facts I promise this stuff will start to become fun	0
Its going to look like this okay if I go ahead and do my circling	0
Right	0
Five people are experts eight can do them	0
No no	0
Youre more than welcome to check mine if you want Im going to check yours just to make sure that you added everything correctly	0
These are some big examples	0
Im trying to give you something that you can just look at	0
Starting over	0
Lead with strong voices since were finished	0
That s what you re going to be doing today	0
It didnt say how much more would you have paid	0
Okay well you have to wait till your partner is done because Im not sure why youre done and your partner is not	0
And lets do some math	0
Now I got switched to my other player	0
Well know what kind of problem it is based on that information	0
Okay	0
The parts are called atoms	0
Im going to actually draw the partition rectangle	0
I got confused with this thousand so Im going to draw my lines because I want to make 100 sure that everything is lined up correctly	0
Because youre basically doing is writing you have twenty seven three times	0
I have 17 and 34	0
After can one do times 15	0
12	0
So we got four times 10 is 40 four times two is eight we got 48	0
Awesome	0
Because once again with the test I had a lot of actually I havent seen yours yet but from the other classes	0
I write those equal to each other so this time things gives me this and this times this gives me this then I get a quadratic  quadratic I solve it and I get 17 thirds	0
First just some private think time	0
Okay	0
Slope is for example how much it goes up by every 1x	0
So its ten	0
There are two people	0
Were going to start with the same one because I think starting with the friendly number 6 times 10 is always your best choice	0
Now please listen	0
Thats the same thing as that vertical line hitting the graph twice	0
Okay	0
And Eloise my phone will not stop ringing but Eloise actually texts me and she says Can I come to dinner too	0
The original number was seven and eight onehundredths	0
Its going to be more than two seconds	0
Get started	0
The answer	0
Okay	0
Does it work	0
Theres no grade on it	0
I have a nine in the hundreds place and a one in hundredths place	0
That is so weird to me	0
So Im gonna stop you for a moment Amir	0
Today were going to be working with adding decimals and so I have hundredths scripts for you to use	0
Okay	0
A half divided by two would mean how many twos are in the half right	0
All right so your title partial quotient	0
I remember in Mr  class we drew that little guy	0
So anyway you can then go on to play	0
The fifth one would have 20	0
So you do things and we do things in life in order	0
If it is one I should see this	0
So what did they have you do for	0
Be a responsible fourth grader	0
Yeah	0
The student on duty come up and clean up the blackboard	0
Crew on your next clean page in your math notebook I want you guys to write solving more ratio problems	0
Were going to skip that for right now	0
Whats happening to my dot as it goes through the first 90 degrees of turn	0
Triangle	0
At this point you have a measure	0
All right	0
Spotcheck a few of them because Id like you to move on to the questions	0
Thank you	0
But you need to be able to support it	0
Because if we say two plus six plus three plus four plus three plus six thats a total of 24 people	0
One way to multiply decimals is to use place value to make the calculation simpler	0
There you go	0
How could you come up with conclusions about what happens if you add the same number to every number  Im going to walk around hear what youre talking about maybe provoke you with some questions but do the work	0
Im going to just ask somebody to come up	0
Lets go	0
One red pen or crayon	0
Okay	0
Yes you can divide them again by oh no	0
Right	0
Okay because heres what I dont want	0
That ones not right	0
Would the X of this guy be the same as the X of this guy except ones positive and ones negative	0
I would start all over	0
Cut it	0
See you tomorrow	0
What if you started out with Bug and tried to smaller	0
All we have to do you can just write since youve taken the time to explain and to paraphrase you dont have to write the whole explanation out	0
Okay like from this course on youre going to hear about domain and range	0
Okay	0
Just like cats and dogs are not the same animals Eve these are not the same size pieces	0
So itd be between two and three	0
That would work then youre saying	0
That was the interpretation of the data in the context in which it was given	0
So in between zero and one theres a half	0
Hopefully your group can help you	0
two three friends three mile relay race with three friends	0
Yes	0
Nice job	0
All right this is your chance to ask not only Chris but also Raymond here	0
That way we can turn them on together	0
It doesnt matter	0
I did 13 times 20	0
Algebra	0
I cant see those numbers	0
So Im doubling something Im tripling something Im quadrupling something	0
Okay	0
Up two over one	0
It is very important that you remember your number	0
Im not going to mess with that right now	0
Thats a great way to go	0
You will be making folding papers to represent models to represent fractions	0
Excellent job	0
There	0
Plus ten	0
Oh you did this	0
But I think in this situation you wouldve just added and it wouldnt be multiplication	0
Yes we know that decimal numbers are quite a bit smaller like in this case	0
Okay	0
But they have different y values	0
Like that one fails the function tests	0
Okay	0
Im going to tell you something	0
So you need to know what eight times four is	0
I am going to divide	0
Yes	0
My question wasn t perhaps clear let me ask it again	0
Remember our data needs context so we need a title	0
Okay	0
Thats what I was looking for buddy	0
This is one since it is a game where you can write this constructive response with a partner	0
What I am going to have you do is Im going to have you go by table groups to look at the data that is up there	0
We have three we have a box we have another boxnine	0
Good job figuring that out	0
Without measuring them she said angle B is larger than angle A	0
Okay	0
And remember the no repeats part for today because pretty much actually all three of the ones were going to work on have repeats	0
Okay	0
Theres your for every statement for every 110 of 8	0
There	0
Why is there money on the wall	0
Okay	0
The points on the card and  and all that depends on how many rides youre on	0
Shh	0
Elliot was  four foot five	0
And when I say clues they will give you two rows that are completed	0
To go from B to H you go over one up three	0
Well continue  this Friday	0
Split into fourths because 6 x 4  4	0
Write it down and then Im going to ask you to be able to explain it	0
1 x 1 is 1 2 x 2 is 4	0
It would avoid us because every time therell be minuses well make a mistake	0
Maybe cut them all into eighths	0
The important thing is once you have the numbers try to say something about what you noticed happened to the numbers	0
Okay so the x values are called the domain the y values are called the range thats probably the most important thing you can get for today the x values or the domain the y values are the range	0
So today we have create diagrams	0
Its like parts where they are negative	0
Youre right	0
Then they will close it	0
Okay	0
Maybe timesed it by two instead of by three or maybe	0
So I see what youre saying	0
Six	0
Im going to try and cut my card like this in my hand because the answer is on the back	0
Two	0
I want you to look at your fraction circles and I want you to see if you come up with something that would be equivalent to one third	0
All right lets go to the second section	0
Okay so it has two factors	0
Wait wait so whats the numbers	0
Please do your drawing and solve the problem	0
Do your tick marks first	0
So Andre four boxes	0
I love everyones  thinking  in here	0
I have four things dude	0
Then four or more correct is good	0
This is how you prove it	0
Like why this and this are related	0
Because you have the best math teacher in the world	0
Speak up	0
Also only one person touches the cards	0
Okay so talk about it in context were talking about Lilith and Noahs ages	0
And then to balance it	0
Is four	0
Great job	0
Cool	0
They probably live to be around the humans age	0
You need to find the mode the median and the mean you have some space here to do your ordered value bar graph and then after you analyze your data I want to know what you think is the best representation of the data and then I want to know how an additional value would affect the median	0
So you have to come up with a rule	0
So now she has half of that	0
Right	0
I have to go grab something downstairs	0
So now I will not look at equation number two anymore	0
Im going to share on example student work piece	0
Thats 50	0
Yes	0
Here when you said 23	0
My sister had a goldfish it lasted a week and she had to dump it down the toilet because she killed it	0
All right we got some great tables here	0
Dont come ask me	0
Okay	0
This is okay you know	0
Ill give you a second to write that out	0
Miriam you want to work with a partner or at the table	0
Going back to last weeks lesson	0
I also prefer rectangles rather than circles	0
Matias make sure I can see your work on every single problem	0
Awesome job	0
Use the pictures or equations to show what you did to find your answer	0
Like one or two	0
We dont need whiteboards anymore so just put them on the ground	0
Okay	0
We have at least two different  positions here	0
And you solved problems for homework on this topic which I now firstly would like to correct	0
who cannot get in	0
So example one	0
A player claims a game board square when that player has initialed sections making up more than half of the square	0
I forgot about it	0
Okey dokey	0
I know	0
Lets talk about the next one	0
You re like okay	0
Your name is on the list today sell the left to his feet and was running even before his friend had finished speaking	0
When youve written your explanation of how you knew	0
The way that it works when you buy koolaid is you buy these little packets	0
I need you to ask for help	0
Okay	0
Stay up on the grading so youre not just doing your homework but actually knowing if youre doing your homework correct	0
Awesome	0
Okay	0
Nice job	0
You guys are finished talking now too	0
How will we	0
The way I did it was I Since one of the sections is 10 total if you divide	0
Right	0
Hi Abby	0
Okay Julia turn your microphone on	0
Okay	0
So I always like to think I think graphs are fun to break apart in terms of the story	0
So your answer to that should be about four	0
expanded standard notation numbers	0
I play football not basketball	0
Okay	0
If you multiplylike if you multiply any number by zero youll get like zero	0
You know that 7x3 is 35 and how many zeros do I have	0
Go	0
Okay we read it together	0
Okay	0
So number sentence number four were still going to get the same answer of one but here is what you have to do	0
So go ahead and start off	0
I see	0
Can I write a number model	0
And thats still one quarter	0
Yes	0
The total amount you would have paid was 464	0
I think you  page	0
But were gonna do three questions	0
That is zero and two  zero	0
Sorry	0
Just be normal	0
Because you dont double the second numbers	0
So you added another zero and then you wrote that	0
So we ask at the post office has anybody noticed at the post office there are boxes with different shapes	0
Youre solving this problem partial sums	0
Okay	0
If you plot those three points you get exactly what is on your graph there	0
And then the next one is 75	0
Very good	0
Infinite cloner	0
Of course I erased his beautiful work	0
The results	0
Yes	0
Be honest	0
As would I	0
That kind of looks like an X	0
Have a look at those equations	0
And then well talk about how to compare that theyre congruent	0
Shes looking for a way to come up with a  particular pattern that shes identifying that	0
Our next step today is I can draw a diagram that represents a ratio and explain what it means	0
Thank you good listeners	0
Our answers was um 24th 36ths 48ths 510ths 612ths714ths 816ths 918ths and 1020ths	0
Learning intention for today	0
This is an important question	0
Are these students actually in the class	0
All right last one looks a little bit different	0
This one were just talking through it	0
Im going to give you guys one more minute and then were going to talk about these two answers so far	0
Thanks Jaden	0
Stay there Alan	0
You use a fraction and it gets smaller and smaller	0
Yes	0
We have these grouping symbols right here	0
Ive heard some very nice thinking on  this	0
Now were going to talk about putting numbers fractions in order	0
Let me get this now	0
Same side interior angles	0
All right	0
Again you may not finish this whole thing in 20 minutes but Im going to give you a 20 minute time for you to build in a five minute break	0
Well that was kind of sad	0
Theyre in this category	0
Thank you	0
Why not	0
Look at the town map on the next screen	0
Were going to go from there today and hopefully youll find some problems pretty interesting today that were going to be working on	0
cover your nose	0
So Moe has seven Mojo seven and zero halves	0
I understand	0
So we are going to try a couple of examples to better understand how we get to this point	0
Were going to simulate an experiment here whereby we have to find out how many chocolate chips Ive got to put into a mixture to create six cookies	0
Okay	0
All right	0
So this is similar	0
You had Michelle s way	0
So maybe one and a half	0
Were all going to have an answer and a way we got our answer	0
Erik Just move this over	0
Use your geometry templates	0
It might be how many words your data says for every one word you say	0
Is asking what this number times this number is	0
Everyone is at a zero	0
Wow	0
Thats your y intercept those five spots	0
And two zeros	0
What information is the problem giving me	0
Anyone else need sciSors	0
Seven	0
You said that it was okay to if you did those operations	0
All right	0
the partners are not doing in their jobs	0
Yes and today were going to go to one point four	0
Yeah and which color I guess Ive used all of them	0
That s reasonable	0
Oh busted	0
Let s put that in that was two huh two	0
So thats like the equivalent of saying Oh I went down three I went over to down three over two	0
So that is my one half	0
Two things need to happen before we go anywhere take a break	0
Put that over there	0
I just know that they got 10 20 I got  but I dont know what it represents	0
Then  do you have a Khan Academy account	0
Its A to M times B to M	0
Here s the microphone let me get out of the way	0
Sweatheart get up and move	0
These cute little critters like to eat scorpions	0
so theyre each going to run three fourths of a mile which is you were overthinking it	0
Lets look at section two	0
I want everyone to have this out in front of them	0
This is gum	0
I wanted to pose just a little bit more on part C before we move on to our next part	0
Youre going to round to the nearest tenths place	0
We got Melissay	0
Rachel in the same room	0
Then I guessed nine seven or give me a guess for mine	0
Stella would you pull your papers out from yesterday so that I could use those as a model real quick to look at	0
And the answer ought to be in real numbers	0
there where the scissors are	0
Okay were going to use this and take it to the next step but instead today we are going to do this with fraction multiplication today	0
However if you used a method like this that Luiko used you will arrive at the answer quickly	0
No one half is bigger than one quarter	0
When you are ready please raise your hands	0
This is the first problem that we solved	0
Oh my gosh	0
So what can we sum up	0
Do we really have to build a robot every single time	0
Great question	0
So we have our two answers	0
Dizzy John	0
Well do that	0
Lets see some friends Im going to give points to because they got their journal out and theyre working and on task nice job	0
I dont know why that one doesnt work	0
his mic is not working	0
I was going to be able to multiply a fraction by a whole number	0
So if you two Angela and Laura if you can come down the front and work with the front two	0
We finished question one and question two	0
Fourteen yes	0
And Adam	0
But since x is always three thats our equation x equals three	0
I know 20 groups of 5 will fit into 100	0
Okay and then well just keep solving 2x plus 200 equals 180 minus 200	0
And this is this would have been good for you to use when you were answering the reading questions as well	0
Two	0
This problem	0
Okay	0
Use the method listed on the blackboard	0
because had you you would have had 5 6 7 8	0
Jonathan you may move your desk back by Zachs	0
Thats actually showing two weeks now	0
Now the first two examples weve done have been kind of lucky because the y intercept has just been given to us	0
So the kind of difference between these symbols is this symbol is talking about like the actual angle itself	0
On your own I would like for you to complete the problems on 163	0
But I dont want you to be confused if you see these words on your homework	0
Weve talked about equivalent fractions	0
So the first thing Im going to do is Im going to get rid of the y by subtracting it from both sides	0
So lets work it out	0
He brings this image	0
Yeah	0
If you are standing and have not gotten a partner yet	0
Thank you	0
You have the assignment that I gave you which is due Friday	0
This isnt quite perfectly accurate because we would have some points left but at 16 right here it would be just right above	0
Yes	0
Tenths	0
Think about using those rules	0
This  is a good challenge for you two	0
Have a seat	0
Quiet	0
Well I have to	0
Okay so guys Rachel and Dan are growing plants in science class	0
Okay some definite confusion on this one	0
Exactly	0
Please open your notes to a clean page and your title today fractions to decimals	0
Yeah	0
That is	0
Show me	0
Two divided by two is one four divided by two is two	0
Were going to start with person number one	0
All right	0
Okay that would  change	0
Yeah	0
Join a group	0
All right	0
Please have your Looking for Pythagoras book on your desk	0
Okay	0
Good	0
12	0
Because her solution is a lot of this data and she used the data to get to this idea	0
Youre going to get some practice problems that are just like that	0
Now  13 plus 14	0
I havent heard from Nessa	0
Sorry	0
It doesnt start at the origin because it has that upfront cost	0
This is not only a sample it is a finished sample	0
Thanks for asking	0
Okay	0
Its number five	0
just the words	0
I want you to think about this	0
Okay	0
you are going to be using one of these models as you are showing your work	0
Mmhmm	0
Write it down	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
And friends when I go back if you are not participating when I look at this it gives me um the names of the people that participated and the names that it did not	0
Okay thats our missing information you need to know that segment JI is congruent to segment IE	0
Yes if thats the decimal you were talking about Im sorry I misunderstood	0
story	0
Yes	0
Were going to focus on what does the rule even mean	0
Where they	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Yeah you guys got it	0
And I drew a five by eight	0
Were going to do Ellen and Elise Corbin and Brandon Hunter and Dane and then Dane and Ingrid	0
So we talked about how you can see your slope on the graph here and here	0
Now we could add one more thing to our title and Ill give you a hint	0
Look at it	0
Mila I know you have it youve done problems like this which is awesome	0
I solved it	0
So this becomes three and 1218	0
Youre treating this as a whole piece of land	0
It might help other people  follow it so let s give David another chance and then maybe  Michael can help him out and Meredith	0
That will turn out like this	0
I know where youre at	0
That equals to seven and I multiply two times three	0
Sit up please	0
All right	0
Uh that depends	0
Yes sometimes I think it does	0
So you guys have done this before youre going to talk about how other people solve the problems and then youre going to get a chance to revise	0
We said one fifth  equals two tenths	0
Eight is two	0
Okay	0
Helena is designing a logo for a school club	0
This science table needs to be covered with plastic for a messy experiment	0
Please do a different one	0
Yes	0
Dont ever grab their pencil out of their hand and do it for them ask them the questions that you think I would ask	0
When you move parts of the pentagon angles change in degrees but this does not affect the sum	0
So your job is to think about this part and whats the perimeter	0
Okay take that	0
One two	0
What were trying to figure out is when Y 10 thats up here where would my graph connect to this line is what we are trying to figure out when Y 10	0
But lets keep that idea that I want us just for now to focus on  the interval between zero and one and I want to be able to place fractions as many  fractions as you can imagine and then lets use even talk about some that you cant fit  here because it gets hard to squeeze them in but that you could imagine	0
Instead let me just tell you	0
All right SS voice off in 3 2 1 and 0	0
Are these correct if these are the ages	0
These are congruent by side side side	0
Yeah so you substitute in two fourths for half and end up with three fourths	0
Three	0
Thats what I said	0
Then on number eight it says to choose one of the problems above and demonstrate a model	0
That means well have to take a look at whats in the parenthesis	0
Intersect	0
Over on your weekend	0
So that my friends we need to write down our notes	0
Yes	0
If you finish three and four  five and six	0
Thats how you define	0
So if you remember we had open dots and closed dots	0
10	0
So if youre missing any Monday assignments or practice tests make sure you get those done as well and send me an email	0
But remember yeah because they did 1 divided by 4 yeah	0
If you just wanted to just not even have this at all and just do that	0
So youre looking at this line as Y equals X	0
Four over three which is equal to one and one third	0
Okay	0
Do youlet me grab a pair	0
I love how polite you just were Bruce	0
So	0
I see	0
Theyre question number three	0
perfect that I appreciate how you That the geometry words to to show that	0
Okay and thats because zero and three theres a difference of three there	0
no	0
So we just have R cubed	0
Thank you	0
So now the rest of you take a look at it Dan was just mumbling over here by the blackboard	0
Or four fortyeighths	0
After youve got something good like a uh a diagram with a pentagon and and maybe a formula even you might probably save that	0
You should have one number on this	0
So we are all right here	0
The equation here when I look at it entirely as it is I will erase the one above so we see it well all right	0
Because if its 90 and 39 you know the third ones gonna be	0
I got it right	0
So domain means exes	0
Then 42 2	0
that made them similar	0
So please write that question down in your notes	0
Okay	0
I dont think you realize it	0
Were you nervous	0
And we leave the second one alone	0
Guessing is not allowed in my classroom	0
Thank you	0
If the vertex is actually on the circle you have secant and a tangent right here or two secants here	0
You have to be able to model your thinking	0
So people if youre sitting at your desk taking notes write the opposite	0
Okay so thats intercepts	0
I can t multiply seventeen by itself	0
So you kind of have to split it up like this	0
This on a scale of one to five one being achieving mass problem five being a challenging math problem where would you put this	0
So least the greatest no repeats	0
No you did not you had different answers	0
Matt Matt Matt	0
Threefourths of	0
I have an answer for M  Yes I do	0
Go ahead	0
So sorry By two to get six	0
I dont know	0
And this is partial quotients division	0
36 equals something	0
Once you are finished please put this into your math section of your binder	0
What the	0
I think that might help	0
Well thats not very helpful	0
Okay lets look at student Bs work	0
Yes	0
Thats a good idea	0
3 x 5	0
This this is what you need to understand	0
Back to your desks	0
And then you could divide it into ten pieces	0
Okay so it starts at 16	0
Okay	0
And three fours is closer to a whole	0
Make sure you stay in the Google meet until 255 and Id like to answer any questions that people have	0
Okay so our equation for this one same deal this equal this	0
So thats a ray	0
So we always moved to the side first on the X axis	0
It cant be 12 and 13 and 13	0
Im sorry	0
You must do minus four X	0
How are you doing	0
Alright so this is the rise over here	0
Okay so heres student work from today	0
I was listening in on the conversation and I thought I heard something different	0
And for reference a tight tight rope walker is off there to the right	0
Okay	0
Okay so lets draw some arrows	0
Yes you could	0
Yes Laura s supposed to coach you through number five	0
I would like all of you to pay attention	0
Try to come up with some different situations	0
Yes that too we would certainly need it	0
We can use our knowledge of multiplication to double check	0
They changed both of them	0
Dont look we are not answering right now	0
Im like Of course you can come	0
Because she didnt I dont know	0
All right	0
Look at number two	0
Thats why were doing this together Alexander so that we make sure were getting it the way we need it done	0
Okay	0
Wheres your math book	0
Probably two maybe three if we have time	0
All right three two one zero	0
Are you feeling better now	0
Interesting	0
It should not start down here	0
You would change 210 to 20100	0
I dont ever tell people I ask people	0
Perfect	0
All right	0
Yes	0
Take a few minutes to examine the titles and labels and discuss what the line plots represent	0
Have a seat	0
And then and then well get started on that short quiz	0
When  need more of that	0
I need to start the lesson again	0
It works for this one	0
Alright	0
You can definitely do that	0
You think it was funny	0
Youre right	0
So one 12 x 6 x 6 and then Im going to have the root 3 at the  end	0
Okay	0
Okay thats a good one	0
Ill give you the answer key but youre still responsible for knowing this stuff	0
Today I learned and now I can	0
So if I divide 24 by 10 I had a 2 in the 10s place and a 4 in the 1s place	0
If you dont have much written in your board youre writing what I write	0
I was talking about	0
He actually divided 13 divided by 3	0
The domain guys	0
And this is supposed to be a three	0
I noticed that a lot of you for your very first response you said that you felt that 1 is your typical value	0
Thank you	0
Or if you click the question Help button it will show you it as well	0
Dear Cousin I would like to congratulate you for winning the archery competition that was held at my castle last week	0
She said divide it	0
Beck why dont you run over with Kirsten and Andrew why dont you run over with Georgia	0
Yes	0
But if you understand it then it doesnt matter at all	0
So tell me when youre ready to think about it	0
So we can see here with Movie Buster that if you dont rent anything you dont pay anything	0
No that is the surface area	0
Over 2 years	0
Okay put your pencils down	0
Okay	0
Youve got bubble wrap all around your car so its fine	0
Thank you	0
Okay	0
So Im going to ask you a question	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
Once again you get to pick who you think is going to win	0
Were doing nine point four today	0
Thats way more than I asked you to do so if you dont have all that on your warmup thats okay	0
We all seem a little tired	0
That might help a lot but do that after class okay	0
Just add the eight	0
Which is half of what you need	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
Good	0
This one says 15 of a block of cheese	0
Sebastian can you close the door	0
Okay	0
Right	0
Wed have to have four halves of the glass to share	0
So once you have youre going to explain what it actually means	0
We changed our minds to less	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
So look at the way mine are	0
Thank you	0
Awesome	0
Okay Addisons there	0
They are filming in this chicken coop	0
Dont think so just borrow	0
Yeah	0
These are just examples for you guys later on	0
Okay you are going to write a fraction that models each situation	0
And so Im going to give you guys give each partnership two numbers and I want you to come up with a number problem to pose to the class using those two numbers	0
Yep I have Josh	0
I noticed that there are different shades of colors	0
Im proud of the way that youre thinking about this and youre trying different ways	0
You may	0
There  that would if you look down it would equal up to a blue	0
So we could imagine this line going on and on and on	0
Okay and I want you to round up to the nearest tenth	0
Im going to write that down	0
Ill take your books tomorrow too	0
That equals seven	0
Okay	0
Like I did number two on the other page too	0
Go back a spot	0
Showdown	0
All right	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
US traditional	0
Actually write them on there and ways in which theyre different	0
So its for Friday	0
Three being its kind of neat like Hadleys hers is kind of neat its just that little bit at the end	0
You have two more questions here	0
Okay	0
Is this a decomposing one	0
Okay	0
Lets go ahead and were going to go up to 23 so zero 13 and then 23	0
Okay so the thing I want you to notice is that so if you have a flat line or a vertical line in your mind you should be like Okay this is a weird special equation	0
All right then	0
Hi Gabriella	0
Two four six eight 10 12	0
Instead of having it divided into two parts the center you divide into three parts because the 2 is now worth 200 and the 6 is now worth 60	0
Okay	0
And go around this way	0
we just split it up differently	0
I dont get it	0
This one involves distribution or combining like terms	0
Find their average okay	0
Erase that line that you just put in there	0
All right	0
Good guess	0
Because I know that I can subtract 18 minus 58 so I took one over here then made it eight eights and the  because I can subtract the 58	0
Okay so remember the slope always goes with slope always goes with the x to y equals mx plus b	0
And the one the least was subtracted from thats the number one	0
They talk a lot about true statements and false statements and they usually say open sentences and I want to make sure we agree on what they are	0
So a couple people might have to adjust theres a little bit	0
X equals 15 over four	0
It could be animals	0
So this is not a function	0
So in this picture angle one is congruent	0
Since I wont be needing this one anymore	0
Lets do it	0
An airplane goes down the runway before it takes off	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
So if you need any help with anything or want to just work on some assignments together let me know yesterday was actually a great day of advisory bunch of people met with me and we did some great problems	0
All right let me just	0
When we need to change our thinking we change our thinking thats what good math students do	0
Those brackets	0
I just realized that because were splitting the pieces into average so theyre equal isnt that just like division	0
Okay	0
You need to be part Not only listen but you need to give information as well	0
Yeah Ive seen some great great sloped triangles too	0
So and he broke it into one plus one and a half plus a half	0
Awesome	0
Cinnamon flavoring is very strong so only 18 teaspoon is used for a batch of lip balm	0
They have a sloth	0
Show me where the denominators are	0
So were going to put the little parentheses and were going to put 900 minus because thats the total number of newspapers	0
Think about money	0
Okay don t look in the bag	0
You have your own dot in a color	0
okay so kite has two pairs of equal sides but theyre not opposite of each other	0
And you can start here	0
He said taller	0
No youre going to have to wait and see	0
I need you to keep that in mind	0
That cute smiles only gets so far if you don t know the answers	0
Okay	0
Okay the 230 of this 230 X stays the same	0
If you want to go back and work on journal cases you may	0
Thats the end of the lesson	0
You have 17 different	0
Okay	0
Lets go to the lesson now	0
Your answer by the numerator	0
Radius	0
And Ive done half the pie	0
Im going to pass those out	0
My names Ms Villarin I dont know if Ms Ferrant told you about me but I planned with Ms Ferrant last Friday  and I also have a seventh eighth grade math class	0
Between so when were thinking of numbers that this is between were going back to	0
Thats what I want you to think about	0
If we look at Hadleys same thing	0
We just got a radius	0
All right	0
Tomorrow	0
Well simple	0
What what are we supposed to do	0
Thats 85	0
So put your whiteboards away	0
Sweet	0
These we havent all done yet those are new	0
you used some words to explain but that proves that they have more money	0
He can make six whole pizzas	0
office	0
All right 10th person comes along	0
Would you like to do it on this side	0
Alright hopefully you enjoyed that	0
After drawing the picture Jake decides he wants to put the picture of the larger book on his folder	0
Okay all right	0
Your job is to match the correct orderedvalue bar graph with the correct line plot	0
You have to have a really solid foundation and some skills in order to be able to use other skills	0
Oh I dont see it	0
Nicely done	0
Okay	0
And you kind of go through theres only three angles that are the same	0
Youre linked to the Google Classroom sweetie	0
I know normally we work in pairs	0
Oh no	0
Im gonna do the opposite order though	0
Another name for that point is the origin	0
And 11 times 10 is 110	0
Do the best you can to cut straight right on the dotted lines	0
Its 14A 15B and 17B actually 16 too	0
All right	0
Marylin come on up	0
One way that people approach this problem is they do this	0
The first option is that you can continue working on a sheet of paper	0
Could you look at mine	0
Eight nine 10 11	0
Before we look at our math message for today our math message is about pita bread	0
Hmm	0
This is where Im confusing you so Im going to stop	0
All right so now friends show me your note fractures please	0
Yes	0
So I have to take two to the third power and multiply it by itself twice	0
I know you were Gerogia	0
Copying the answer book	0
Yes	0
Linda was told nine bookmarks	0
Okay	0
Divide it in half	0
Vertical	0
Yes	0
Times two was hard to see but there is a times two there	0
Okay so so in this exercise were just using were just using our number stem	0
Two sixths plus one fourth	0
I m hearing you use words like unlikely and impossible	0
Okay	0
So one way you could approach this is you could say Okay well I know y equals slope times x	0
We need to have	0
So there is no minus	0
Okay so heres how they modeled this drawing	0
Take your answer book in front of you then we can check if you did it right	0
Very good	0
Now Here you go	0
Yes	0
All right	0
Wait what	0
So that means that were going to multiply the numerator and the denominator to get this to 24	0
Look at the table	0
I want to hear from one more person	0
I always do it right	0
Were going to add that to five times 56	0
Yeah	0
No	0
That is Example two	0
Does anybody else have problems with their extra rectangles to figure the area	0
You are more than welcome to come join me in the front if you would like to	0
Thatll be easy to make from the fractions	0
But then youre only going to model one of them over here	0
This is the data we collected	0
But sir arent we off then sir	0
With the 2000 kilometer trip	0
Connect the last one to that	0
Show me	0
Sure	0
01 turns into 10	0
Okay	0
You got it	0
The new picture is called an image	0
So dont really see how that would equal threetwelfths	0
My microphone is wonky because Ive got this thing on too	0
Okay	0
Whoa	0
Yeah	0
Actually I dont think this is going to show up on yours	0
I think you have eight different sentences	0
Were still in the parentheses	0
zero comma negative three	0
I always love when my math book is across the room	0
Six times five is 30 seven times five is 35 eight times five is 40 four times five is 20 three times five is 15	0
I see a lot of people not done with five and six so were not going to go over it yet	0
Now 6 times 22 I would not use that	0
Okay	0
Or do you think itll be okay	0
I have fraction pieces that are greater than a whole	0
The fastest middle schooler in this school probably can do the 100meter dash in like 12 seconds maybe	0
Come get these and move your desk by Matt	0
Okay number two	0
Not just because were on the robot cam	0
so for pq the equation and there were a couple questions in seventh period about this	0
It s not too bad actually because then when I combine all my like terms I just get this	0
2x plus y plus x equals 180	0
Blake Im not sure where you went to	0
Show me your fingers how many more minutes you think you need	0
A can be 10	0
She is sick	0
Its really no different math its just that you gotta watch out that youve got two fences to deal with here	0
Remember who your partners were	0
No	0
Okay Michelle and Monica make room for Albert and his friend	0
I am so excited I won something yesterday	0
In a few minutes thats exactly the level of noise and talk I want about math	0
Lets see what you can do	0
Thats this point that touches the y axis here	0
At the end of the day its going to be sad if you havent learned math than you know exactly where the iPad has been pointing the whole time	0
So really nice job you guys	0
Good	0
That is your job today	0
Okay	0
Oh these erasers things	0
Let everybody in here	0
You have to  think hard about it	0
Okay thats Ms Silver has got those 56 kids again	0
That that helped me a lot	0
Yeah	0
I think we don t have enough light green	0
You werent able to figure that one out either	0
Its not always possible but if its possible thats where I wouldve started	0
Were gonna build on it and were gonna add to it	0
I am going to be grading this based on your revised thinking showing that you were listening you were on task with your group and you learned something new	0
We could right	0
Excellent	0
I want to hear a conversation about what you think the mistake was and how can you prove what is actually correct	0
Its not 10 times four	0
And I have to use the rest of my dividend	0
So your slope for this one	0
But if you at a minimum these are the biggest topics these are most of the questions	0
No	0
Thank you very much Meredith	0
Try to find the patterns patterns	0
OK	0
This family of all places they live on a street called Pirate Street if you can even believe it	0
Okay so you need to connect those two	0
Whats this skull and bones stuff	0
81 was 81 then you connect the two lines	0
6 times 7 equals 42	0
If I am interpreting something Miriam and Laura I am looking at it and explaining what that word problem is telling me	0
Following along with your finger point to the name of the person who this is about	0
Hello	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Just put your mask over your eyes	0
The Ys changed	0
All right joke of the day and then well get into our two investigations for today	0
Thin crust pizza	0
To measure it	0
I want you to solve this problem with an algorithm and I want you to solve it with a model so both ways	0
See if you can make one third	0
Just think about that in your mind right now	0
What number	0
Go and Roge	0
Calculate the length of the diagonal of the parallelepiped	0
You guys stop talking	0
That is what the mathematicians often do they do exactly that they put the numbers to  the left of zero as the negative and the numbers to the right of zero as the positives and by  the way since we are already into high school math we might as well give you a little bit  more high school math	0
If I have a fraction like 13 and I look at it on a ratio table and I say I know that theres tenths places and hundredths places but I cant count by 3s to get to 10 or 100 or 1000	0
Do I just do the first page	0
All right	0
Yeah well times a second	0
And if I were to draw this one out as sixths and if I want to fill one of them in then I would have a little bit less than onethird	0
Okay	0
Oh by the way guys I like how you labeled them like that	0
Yes everyone needs to	0
Thats not a lot thats three movies a week	0
Oh okay	0
Were going to try it out though	0
No	0
Class give me five real class	0
If angle one is already 160 then angle two and angle three are equal	0
Twice a number	0
Yes	0
Bring the material over there now Ill give you the transparency to complete	0
Okay	0
Andrea Adam	0
To find out 34 of 8 we multiply	0
So stick it over there	0
Mr Who	0
Yours was a number less than six	0
Your homework is not in order	0
So	0
Theyre equivalent but theyre not the same	0
No	0
No no yes it was	0
Cool	0
Lucille write these in	0
Okay 19 thank you	0
And I want you to only do problems one two and three	0
I didnt even know that existed	0
Okay move your desk	0
Your partner should be listening to you and theyre going to summarize what you did	0
So the lowest it ever goes is negative four	0
SS right lets switch gears to the homework and that was a long warmup for today	0
So fifteens got to be in the box	0
Friends Im not worried about completing this journal page right now so dont try to rush and complete it	0
The ones that are shown in the graph uh uh the equations	0
Yeah	0
Yep right there in that corner	0
So we have another vote for 23	0
Give it to Clay	0
Okay	0
If I go 10 10 steps to the right	0
Down here theres a lot of thinking on this paper and I felt really terrible that this person put so much effort into their thinking and I cant see what it is	0
This person got it right	0
This would be our voice levels in this classroom are perfect youre doing just what youre supposed to be doing	0
Or if its a rectangle the diagonals are equal as well	0
Bobby I didn t hear you	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
There you go	0
Asher I need you to sit up and you may not be in that chair	0
Three quarters is on the other side of the half	0
All right go	0
Not sure	0
Hello hello hello	0
If yours were very similar if not right on this is what I want you thinking about	0
Come to your computer shared screen now	0
Your run is five goes over by five and Im going to go back to the last slide and show you oh look the same thing negative 10 over five negative 10 over five same thing	0
Okay so remember were trying to find a common denominator here so we have	0
And if youre having trouble with systems then this would be especially good time to to really be focusing on these problems and asking questions and figuring out how to work with these systems	0
Plus five X	0
Yes so you were here	0
Because four over 15 is less than a whole	0
So these are your hints for thinking about multiples	0
12w plus five equals nine v minus one	0
Im going to do 30 x 8	0
All right now Ms Haven you may write on the top	0
Were not calling Zoe weird	0
I only need 27 more to be able to get to 207	0
Oh	0
Thanks for sharing Ray	0
If you can get it all done showing all your work you have no homework	0
Okay once you have your fifths and your tenths written give me a thumbs up and Im going to give you a glue stick	0
Thanks Kaden	0
So I add seven to both sides	0
Oh okay	0
You are going to help find a friend whos somewhere on this town in this town map	0
Yes because thats in ratio	0
That s what I thought I heard you say	0
Im seeing some nods and Im seeing some shakes of the head	0
Three X	0
If it if they draw the same it was right	0
That s certainly right uh do you suppose you could	0
Its 491	0
Let me put my screen on	0
Here we go	0
Good thing Mrs Wallaces here cuz Mrs Strathom is losing her mind	0
Two thirds	0
Its a whole number	0
So going back to the multiplication rule and what inverse means	0
Now crew I didnt do a great job of this on the last one but you have plenty of rooms	0
Be careful on this	0
They the diagonals are perpendicular	0
vocabulary words especially in math are hard to remember	0
Thanks for Thanks for working really hard every day in class	0
Thank you	0
Im so glad you brought that up	0
Were going to do in real life we would definitely taste this	0
No no no no you did not accidentally you didnt look at the problem because you rushed through it	0
And hopefully that will help you out just a little bit	0
So start working on that	0
Good morning Mrs  Ms Strathom	0
Im going to give 15 to both of these	0
Oh it was Jane	0
Lets make our pieces the same size	0
Tribe buddy B you are going to say what you think the median is	0
Was it on	0
Yeah	0
Okay so your last question is really just showing how your diagram shows seven eighths is bigger	0
Alright were looking pretty good here	0
This kind of helps you out with the vertical line test	0
Perfect	0
We could scale it up	0
So lets talk about that	0
Then the onethird covered two	0
Okay I have to borrow from the whole and make it a two	0
Right	0
So really what you have is 15 times 175 over 25 and should give you something like 105	0
Oh I guess I should go back to the one that was up there so that you can all see it before we go on to the next one	0
The neighbor will be gone for five days	0
It might happen and it might now	0
So we would drag that guy up here	0
You have five chances to find the treasure	0
So thats definitely not my best place to start	0
Thank you so much	0
So if I do 15 times five thats 25 carry my two and then five times one is five plus two is 75	0
Today were going to learn some other ways	0
So that means to find out how many campers need chaperones we would add this number	0
Okay try this one	0
There you go	0
So my answer would be 534	0
Because we were not here yesterday	0
Crew you saw how to scale up with multiplication you saw how to scale down with division you saw how to add columns	0
So 14412W  and equals	0
There now	0
Now parents for those of you who are not familiar with partial quotients this line is just to help us separate out our work	0
A little harder	0
Hey you guys did an awesome job here	0
Very good	0
Two times two or two squared	0
So if youre taking if you can just divide 22 by two to get a half you can just divide 36 by three to get a third	0
Four point zero zero five	0
There you go	0
Here we go	0
We just know what the entire bottom part is	0
Something I can do if Im not even quite ready to use the tap diagram yet is I can draw each one like Gabby did 18 calendars	0
So Im doing it this way this way	0
Get out our math journal and turn to page 144	0
So for that one this one was not consistent	0
So once you have your table or your points or whatever youre looking at the domain you normally write it out just a list of the x values from least to greatest with no repeats at least a greatest no repeats	0
And I can n is equal to 13	0
Welcome	0
Yes	0
And these are the number of times that number  s rolled	0
When you get done you are to stand up	0
There you go	0
A three is I understand I can work on my own	0
Something you guys might want to do is take your denominator and write it	0
What I mean is Im not finished because its taking me so long because	0
Well umm ten wholes because well these are  originally tenths and this is considered if this  is considered ten then this would be this  would be like switched around ten wholes	0
So you are going to compare	0
The multiplication  is if you  three times one times	0
I m with Michael	0
So two and four tenths times one and three tenths	0
Math message	0
Uh and Ill show you how to do that	0
It is done finito finished	0
Thats awesome	0
Okay example three	0
Oh	0
GEOM	0
Lets do that	0
Now I want you to know something	0
Okay and then see if you can get Leave them on there	0
That would be two out of six which is a third	0
Yes it says 11	0
So these operate kind of a magnet theres a	0
78	0
Edward I cant Oh youre on mute	0
Hmmm thats really interesting	0
Yay	0
Everyones camera needs to be on	0
I dont know	0
And lets actually write this out	0
Okay zero comma nine is going to be 09 in the table just like this	0
Thats fine	0
Conceptually understanding why I do what I do	0
However there are some places that are not well written written written	0
This is gonna be your ones	0
Yes	0
The median were going to say is not applicable or you cant find it	0
Okay thank you	0
We are about to go into fractions	0
When someones speaking you listen it goes into your ear	0
Oh and if that words on the board we better be spelling it right	0
Check	0
Is it better	0
For the 81 with a remainder of one and the nine with a remainder of 16 I dont really think that makes sense	0
You need to have the same denominator to be able to add a fraction and get an equivalent	0
Remember that was because three occurs twice and six occurs twice	0
The directions say draw a rectangle on the grid then fill in the blank	0
And Ive done half the pie	0
So 150  25 is 175 and then 30  5 is 35	0
Lets move on to number two	0
Okay lets try one more	0
Therefore the solution	0
Ben do you normally work with James	0
Awesome	0
It crosses that crosses the y axis at negative one	0
So if we look over here angle CBa so it goes from C To B to A notice how B is the vertex B is the vertex because Bs right here thats congruent we would say this symbol is congruent to pq our angle pq R because they are the same measure	0
And I know that I have to multiply five by two to get 10	0
Ladies and gentlemen without shapes this world is nothing	0
Its going to take you a little bit longer its going to get a little bit more twisted in there	0
Sure or three and three six	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
And that was all about solving equations	0
I think thats supposed to go down to that too right	0
Go	0
We need to  Do you need to leave	0
If I see you not talking then youre not practicing the language	0
Then 5x3 is 15 and then 5x1 is 5	0
Yeah so Gerry is really that guiding diagram piece	0
Yep	0
All right	0
So this one go ahead and add two fifths plus two fifths	0
SOHCAHTOA	0
And you would find that your rise is nine	0
Ourselves	0
Five because thats the one we messed up on	0
Good	0
Youre at the movie theater	0
Area model	0
Two X plus 10	0
Were in the Northern  half of the world underneath is the Southern hemisphere of the world	0
They are really challenging like eating a dried squid	0
Okay	0
So you need to have something very similar to that	0
You can pin Me to the screen which makes me	0
Instead of letter A we used some other examples some kind of gifts to your relatives	0
You all should have your choice written down then you should write it	0
Tobias and Delon	0
Why is it taking so long	0
So seven and three quarters well label them blue eight well label them pink seven and half in orange and eight and one third in green	0
If I said you drank half of your water bottle thats not related to how much water Luke drinks from his water bottle in terms of fractions	0
Well fine	0
Get help from a friend if you need help	0
OK so this was using this equation	0
The bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces	0
If you show me through drawing that tells me you understand conceptually which means you can actually picture the math problem in your head conceptually with pictures and you actually understand what you re doing	0
Oh thank you	0
And then you label your estimate with B on this number line here	0
Ok thats interesting	0
Okay so she said I want them to be blue so I need to put food coloring	0
So lets do two	0
Can you bring it over your	0
Like I said you guys are going to figure out how to be able to do that on your own in the future	0
Were going to use the word factor when we can	0
4 5 6 7 8 9 930	0
Whoa okay	0
Okay	0
understand multiplication and have them memorized Im going to give you a sheet	0
10 and a half	0
Yes	0
Changing sign thats the opposite piece flip your fraction	0
All right	0
These two sides are longer than one unit	0
When I actually do 16 times 19 I dont know if its going to let me	0
Thats your minus eight same thing from here	0
Sorry	0
Multiplicative identity property means multiplying by one does not change the value of your number	0
Perfect	0
That la two	0
Youre going to have to share those conversations with me	0
Leftover pieces of pizza	0
Okay	0
And I agree with you	0
I think this is a function because all of the domain numbers each one only has one arrow pointing not two arrows or any more than one	0
I want to quickly show you the calendar for this chapter four unit	0
Okay	0
I have a special problem for you today	0
I love that you were able to go in and realize Oh my number was too big	0
Let me see what you did	0
Here is what I need you to start practicing doing because I know 100 my friend here knew exactly how to do this but what threw him off was how many friends does she have	0
But they can both still be correct	0
No	0
Furthermore it says here not that thats a very big deal here it said a plus and you wrote a minus	0
Look right here friends	0
To clear answers to questions and being able to respond clearly to someone that asks you a question to add accurate work to make revisions and	0
So they can listen to me talking to you	0
Good	0
Now looking at them I would like you to think about how your reasonable estimate is going to change	0
All right thats the important minus again which refers to the whole bracket here	0
I m coming through with an answer	0
You are going to need one sheet of a game board which I have and it will be a coordinate	0
But hold on	0
Okay	0
What do yo mean like match them up	0
Ah 20 seconds	0
We take the numerator and we subtract the denominator from it	0
You could do that	0
Plain and simple you use an X X is an easy way to do it	0
and so four times five is twenty and twenty divided by five is four	0
Sponsor A is proportional and linear	0
Make a fourth turn clockwise	0
Okay so now lets check this other number	0
That could be absolutely	0
We each have our four cards and we have our pieces of paper	0
We look forward to your participation	0
Then well talk about what size of angle but theres something interesting about the last two	0
So we just kind of do the same math	0
So they dont have to be perfect but I took each circle and divided it in fit because theres five people	0
He is a good  friend of ours	0
the interruption	0
Let me see X	0
Youre going to make a graph and youre going to use your graph	0
We want to get our cost to 3	0
So do section four and come up with a rule for me	0
Hadley go ahead and add them up	0
All right	0
SS right	0
Here is something I did notice on a couple of papers	0
So inside my box now I am going to write 04 times 07	0
110	0
Okay	0
And these might not be actually easier equation	0
That was the first week of this unit	0
All right	0
From there they tell you to make a new sailboat	0
It might mean something that youve doubled or youve tripled or youve taken half of but it will still be equal	0
I knew that I subtracted three and ended up with eight left	0
Correct okay the last variant Shane those are actually the same ones	0
Okay	0
Now this trick does not work with addition	0
Good	0
Ok	0
And then I could take out another five fifths and then 5 10 15 and then I can take out another five fifths	0
I did not make it more difficult	0
Lets look at the laps run	0
Meredith will talk with you about it  until she talks with the whole class	0
All the square you cannot find the negative result	0
Oh okay	0
We wrote a handful of for every statements	0
Okay	0
We have two more to fill out	0
No I didnt	0
Uhuh	0
Oh I know but if you take the rules that you learned over here and think about that you can make some examples	0
Do this one	0
Oh no you said this is true Im sorry	0
Okay	0
And see what you come up if you work on that	0
Then let me draw another line for the vertical line test	0
Based off my data up there do your axes please	0
Lets do the same thing for B	0
So draw an area model	0
Yes	0
Another foursided polygon it is equiangular but it is not equilateral	0
But Im more comfortable teaching it now than I was seven years ago	0
So you ve had Jeff s way of reading the box	0
So homework 13	0
30 more	0
After youve done tenofour	0
its X	0
All right	0
So we knew that we had a half and a half which we knew equal to a whole	0
Okay friends can I have your attention one more time	0
Yes you wont need the above anymore	0
I want you to stand up hand up pair up	0
You can do this	0
four and 16 is equivalent to 25 16	0
Were all making the same pictures	0
Friends you need four parts across	0
I wanna make sure that every calculator has been brought back	0
Yes	0
Thats a fourth	0
Yeah we know that	0
And so in this case these are actually going to be 85 degree angles because like if x is 30 and we check it back here when x is 30 we get three times 30 minus five which is 90 minus five which is 85	0
That works	0
And I know what the six gave me and it would actually be two more on your chart	0
And then I said In the X coordinate and the Y coordinate but then I crossed that out and said The widths 24 squares long and 30 squares high	0
Weve got numbers run here	0
Okay	0
So just try	0
Yes I think I made	0
So they did take these three but the only problem is their denominator right there	0
Thats what its about	0
Okay	0
Well restate and maybe revise our thinking	0
Jeremiah have a seat	0
Holy moly	0
So you re confused because you re not seeing the combination on the board   and we ve done thirty draws	0
Okay show me your whiteboard again buddy	0
Youre close	0
Didn t we do this one already	0
I love that idea	0
Because if were not focusing were going to miss out on the important parts of the lesson	0
No	0
All right people	0
The yellow with two dark blue	0
Bom bom	0
Because Im having you do it on your whiteboards	0
So I dont know	0
Leslie you said something similar lets see Kathleen said something similar	0
Oh sorry Maddy had her hand up earlier too	0
So now I would like you	0
Somewhere I saw it rounded up to two point four someone else had it more specific	0
Go sit in a corner and do your work	0
Lets start by looking at  so that your	0
All right show me	0
Converting how many pairs are in like whats  of 12	0
You would subtract	0
Bless you	0
You add those two together	0
So youd be like cutting through	0
You are going to solve these five problems together together and you are going to use a sage and scribe format	0
Youre right	0
Good job	0
Very nice	0
And then that should work for a rhombus	0
Great because sometimes they	0
Thats not it	0
You are not even attempting	0
Yes	0
What page	0
So your prediction was right	0
All right	0
Whoever you think is going to win thats who youre going to pick to follow	0
Renata Xavier Hailey Martine Jeremy Josh Viviana Sonia  Judith	0
Try it	0
Excellent job guys thank you	0
So they could show what they did	0
Sit up	0
Good	0
This is one that involves distribution and combining like terms	0
And then a line that was horizontal of a certain length	0
So dont let me forget	0
So that ones perfect	0
Hm	0
Im going to check on the other	0
We have all our choir students please  no Im sorry please meet in the cafeteria thank you	0
Thats a tough word we dont say very often	0
So thats step one in thinking about is this an actual parallelogram	0
I just that was a nice little gift that tied into this unit with asymptotes and all those kind of things	0
Yeah	0
Actually were going to kind of get to the main point for today	0
50 off is 105 right	0
If I have 10 of these before I can make one I had to have actually 10 complete columns and rows	0
Because each tenth is worth 9 you got it	0
And then you can just keep going by three eight plus three is 1111 plus three is 1414 plus three is 17	0
You mean the stuff you forgot to teach us	0
So in the chat box I have one that says I was doing it with another group	0
Hold up	0
And Im going to quickly review this with you	0
They can also be equivalent	0
The light just went off 36	0
So shh	0
Now the next thing I do is the ear	0
Lets do 1 4	0
When you take the time to email me I take the time to	0
Flip your boards over when you are done so I know what groups are done	0
So inside the head now I could draw a brain but I just do it in the eyes for fun	0
So then now we want to find A	0
A lot of you are telling me Oh do PEMDAS	0
So we have zero one fourth a half and three fourths	0
Power of the exponent	0
These numbers are roundedoff	0
That is your code right there	0
Okay	0
Day two is gonna get 123	0
And then theres the and then there is the	0
Now were going to multiply	0
All right	0
Thats going to be a little bit frustrating sometimes if you get one wrong and then you have to go through the rest of the problems to be able to restart	0
Ill come check them for you	0
You knew what was wrong with my problem and its this piece of zero	0
Lets double check	0
I dont know where my fraction circles went	0
Okay cool	0
OK so I think I follow what you said	0
The next sailboat youre going to make youre going to double each number of the original pair	0
And Ill need help from another person with a calculator	0
If you dont like it you do not have to use them	0
Oh one other thing	0
Now I would like to know one side that is the side of the square which is at the same time also the side of this of this triangle	0
We have number sentences	0
And certainly today when we are working on decimals we are working on adding decimals we want to think about making sure that we add the place values together and we dont mix them up	0
Thats your scale	0
Awesome	0
All right	0
Let s see	0
Theory is you could move your finger for ever towards the smartboard and never hit it if you just kept moving in half distances forever	0
All right	0
Thats another same	0
Im not going to tell you if it was high or low Im just going to say clearly their answers did not make sense	0
Ok so what Im imagining when you do that David Im  imagining the rods and Im also imagining the number line	0
Try to find out which is the longest straw that you can thread into this box	0
Okay	0
It is yes	0
Okay	0
Awesome	0
And I cant see at all	0
Theyre different units so Im adding my mixed numbers so Im adding my whole numbers	0
Cecilia and Megan I need you facing this way	0
All right 30 seconds	0
24	0
Im going to use my worlds fastest drying whiteout over here	0
And ameesha and her two sisters were splitting them	0
So I think five different sized shapes here	0
Were on the same side of the transversal	0
Okay lets see how were doing here	0
Check back oh Katie no	0
Youre doing one yes one	0
Thats getting a bit closer to it	0
Okay thats what I would write down in the notebook	0
You could list them anywhere	0
Right	0
This is not very easy to do but what I mean is	0
Awesome	0
Oh	0
That s four	0
Ah right	0
Yeah	0
Because look	0
Thats really what you did	0
Are there questions that where youre like  I have a big question getting in the way of my understanding	0
We want to compare them	0
Theres my number model for you you take three do you need one of the cards	0
I wasnt sure because it goes up a little	0
Okay	0
For number 4 I would like you to discuss the strategy you used with your partner how to find a common denominator	0
But because our objective is you have to do it with fraction pieces	0
The first case is dead	0
This is going to make sense	0
Distance formula	0
So these are  your sixths	0
You guys should be awake	0
All right	0
Come up with your equation and some kind of model	0
Thats really good communication	0
Thank you for handing it out	0
Is it not charging	0
I would like you to explain your shorter route	0
If you have to do this for a test writing this equation between brackets	0
That s  the next question	0
Light green	0
Foundationally of partial products	0
Right	0
I think our internet is moving as slow as we are today	0
So lets say this one is 20 and this one is 15	0
Im teaching you about literacy right now to get you to understand a number sentence which is something that were going to have to understand today	0
Heres your next problem	0
Those three would be the ones that would work	0
Equals just about 144	0
Got to be quicker than that	0
So my friends here is what you are no longer going to say is I accidentally I misinterpreted I didnt look at the problem correctly and I multiplied it by 2 versus 3	0
Zero	0
And then I got 10	0
Building number four had 88 stories	0
In context means a situation in which something happens	0
Okay were not done yet	0
One type of cake is 230 yen each and the other cakes are 200 yen each	0
Because youre just sitting here waiting for me to give you an answer and thats not going to work	0
Please hold up with your fingers how long you need	0
So weve worked on five sections so far in the book	0
I want you to think about these numbers too	0
What Erik said is that two whites equal one red so it would  be the exact same thing	0
22	0
And so just make sure that you are on top of your homeworks	0
I wouldnt make them crazy because you wouldnt	0
Breath in breath in	0
Unless mine was picking it up	0
It didnt matter how many pieces were in that pizza	0
Once you get your paper you may begin cutting out	0
Perfect	0
But if you come over here you cant do one minus two	0
Give everybody a minute to think about it	0
Great job	0
Whoa whoa five one seven three nine five eleven	0
We still dont have the letter F completed	0
Three two one	0
Right	0
That would be this one	0
So eight times two minus 12	0
Three by four	0
It helps me see that pattern	0
Or if you start with one and three fourths and you subtract two fourths you go backwards on the number line	0
Here you do minus 12 but when you did minus 12 here you touched only that 12 there	0
Listen to what shes saying Dwayne	0
You said since 35 to 65 is the same distance as 45 to 75 none of those change	0
Hey guys	0
Well ironically enough lets start with what Mr Isaiah said	0
Hm	0
Okay let me shade in 23 here	0
Maybe you can write an equation to show which fraction is bigger and why	0
Do not solve it	0
Take a look at that	0
Lets see here	0
Landon take a breath dude	0
And practice helps makes make it permanent	0
She is thinking Caroline I love how you said that because youve said that differently than everyone else	0
So that might help you think about whats happening with that graph	0
and then I showed my work right here	0
Okay	0
Someone else may take your you know so you better have a couple of back up numbers	0
So a slope of zero just looks like this	0
So you saw three times three once	0
I will know that you guys are ready when you have finished your conversations and your eyes are on me	0
Hold on	0
All right	0
So thats how we set up our ratio table	0
So if you go to the back side it says play at least two rounds using the game board complete the topic record sheet after each round	0
Oh youre doing 49  that is easier to add those	0
Well write it down	0
And when you multiply 5 x 6 it equals 30 proving those end ones	0
Its not round	0
Tenths place is Put the word upside down	0
Okay	0
Now I have really another goal for  today that I want you to think about the goals so that I am asking you to do some more writing  and Mrs Phillips is asking you to do some more writing this weekend	0
You are perfectly capable of reading your own instructions	0
You can move on to the rest	0
so here is what I would like you to do	0
Yes	0
She added 69 and 59 and got 119 or 1 and 29	0
And look at these	0
If you got 18 figure out why its not 18	0
On the lefthand side it is two X plus 10	0
Its going to be a whole	0
Yeah	0
UV is 8x minus 12	0
All right	0
Thats what I want you guys to talk about	0
Then you need to say I couldnt hear you	0
So you can see some of the work thats going on there	0
Last call to sign homework calendars	0
If I have to say again do not grab the end of it you are going to sit down	0
On your whiteboard I want you to solve in a way that youre doing your own work and I say three two one show	0
Crew heres the last thing that I would like you to do	0
Because I just did 10 2  because 5 is just 2 times or 5x2 is 10	0
Mark your spot	0
No no spell it out	0
Were going to take a break	0
Yes	0
And then	0
Wide	0
That is getting us there	0
Yes	0
But weve already talked about this many times	0
So weve gone through three people now	0
The blue lost	0
I might change your answer just a little bit	0
RRR	0
Dont stand in front of it	0
This is what the identity sheet looks like	0
This time X equals three	0
Okay	0
This ones supposed to be on this one	0
there is not enough for each person	0
I cant make a larger product	0
So thatll be that group	0
Hunter you got five seconds to unmute	0
You have negative here so youre going to find five C to the fourth power over here	0
Page 86	0
So think about what that means	0
Thank you	0
One goes there	0
And lets see what were able to do	0
So far weve just been trying to see how to plot a point	0
So Im seeing some answers in the chat	0
Its subtraction	0
The table is 25 inches wide 38 inches long	0
I will tell you that I dont have anything that you have to do	0
Its a point line Ray or segment that intersects a segment at its midpoint	0
So we have person number one	0
I have 14	0
Divide by 10	0
Ive given you the two fractions you need	0
Yes yes	0
But if they are not simplify it one by one	0
This is not the only partner youre going to have today	0
There you go	0
31 divided by six we know would be five with the remainder of one because six times five is 30	0
Last case is obtuse angles	0
So it makes me upset when I see that people arent trying	0
Since there are five of you the first  number that my rule is going to work on is the number five	0
I wonder	0
Yeah lots of tricks	0
So we know that we can absolutely order from least to greatest with the same denominator	0
Lets give Sawyer a hand	0
Nice and loud	0
20x50 is 1000	0
That s what I am hearing you say Okay	0
downtime	0
It is a lot of money	0
What time is it	0
I need to count	0
You guys have the same  all the same problem	0
Okay	0
Mhmm	0
Now if we have a good idea of where this other point Im going to say up eight over three	0
No	0
You need to move to the other side of Clay	0
Continue playing	0
Okay were looking pretty good on those	0
You could do equal groups you could do conversions you could do area you could do volume you could do comparison whatever works make sure it works	0
Show me active listening so we dont have to come back to the carpet	0
Okay	0
Why dont you take a look at it than	0
We might be summarizing were going to be sharing with a partner	0
Yes we can figure out fraction of fractions pretty quickly	0
I think that is closest to one	0
Some of you dont remember us using a word point in this classroom for any reason	0
Walker  I dont see it then it doesnt matter	0
I know thats a little bit tricky sometimes	0
Yes	0
58 inches tall	0
Any questions so far on the first four	0
Here we go example two	0
In this instance two and a half is the size of the group	0
Maybe maybe	0
Okay thank you	0
No wonder Im really looking forward to have you seen the trailer for the movie Constipation	0
Otherwise thats all I have	0
T	0
All right	0
Okay and hopefully you use one of the strategies we talked about today turning him into 100	0
Now heres what I want you to understand	0
Ok	0
20 so we could do and then it could be all the way up here so it would be	0
Okay all right here we go	0
Thats what its asking you	0
Wait can we work at the back table	0
So Annie broke it down to make it make sense for her	0
Thank you	0
Remember the problem I asked  you to do though if yellow and light green were two not  one	0
Youre working on that one it looks like youre working on a  bigger model here	0
And then Im going to show you the easier way at the end of class	0
Its bigger than half so its closer to one	0
I know that the first one for every number not just prime numbers every number is going to be one and itself	0
Bruce scoot over	0
Chloe and Julia please meet up	0
You can use either strategy one or strategy two in this one	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
Thats what you have to be thinking about	0
Okay so they  want to do the first one	0
Not really	0
Only two people involved in this story	0
No cant be eight	0
So if I look at two numbers that I multiply three times three a reasonable guess if I didnt know my multiplication facts could be ten reasonable guess could be eightit wouldnt be one and it wouldnt be a hundred and one	0
No it doesnt	0
Just give me a second	0
We counted by fives	0
Im going to give you a couple seconds to write this down if you havent already	0
So now we can subtract seven sixths minus four sixths is three sixths and one minus one is zero	0
Then three times nine is 27 over three and two over three and then do you do 27 divided by two	0
All the way to not sure not sure I have no idea whats going on	0
Very good	0
How many times does 3 go into 11 and whats left over	0
Please hurry up and copy the six problems	0
I really struggle with being concise so I appreciate that most of my students are very concise	0
John William Remy was there he just said that you were really glitchy	0
Yay	0
Miriam who are you working with	0
Because I see an answer here and here and here and here and here and here and here	0
So they make a 180	0
I understand now thats really interesting	0
So for warmups you are rounding decimals	0
And in your second model you got a different answer	0
Youre going up by 10	0
All Right	0
Because its only half	0
Youre trying to get something quick and easy thats a gen youre following this pattern	0
Yes	0
You have the sentence starters you will complete that when we are done	0
Its unit rate is less but in the end it gets more treats	0
Thats one fraction you should have on your warmup	0
Okay	0
Oh wait	0
And then turn to page 32	0
Please go ahead	0
Youre like I have to divide it by 8 or 9 or whatever	0
Were going to go a little faster for these last two	0
Because we know already that that three reds would make a  dark green and if there are two dark greens to make the  orange and the and the red rod then it would take six red  rods to make the orange and the red rod	0
So   last class we were talking about our rolling cups	0
They wouldnt get 14 and 15	0
Okay so what that tells me Kelly is that youre not listening and youre not doing your job	0
Thank you	0
If I come around and I find out that youre not working and youre not helping each other Im going to shut it down and Im going to send you back to work by yourself	0
Yessidy yes	0
Ok Brian said something like that too about the numbers being  odd	0
Okay so let me highlight these always a two	0
Then youre individually going to do problem number four	0
Thats pretty convincing	0
3 through 15	0
What I do is at the bottom I have  to do to the top	0
Yikes yikes yikes	0
But were going to think about doing a tastetest here	0
That theyre equivalent	0
No no	0
And then I want you to write down whats happening on the y axis as well	0
So there are some of them	0
So if your friend is  from the gas station	0
This video is going to talk about fractions in terms of adding fractions which weve already went ahead and discuss a little bit like this morning	0
Look you have the slope correct and the starting number correct except the starting number is always written at the end	0
But that makes sense because theres more milkshake	0
Wait can you solve it	0
seeing some great work so far	0
Im moving you down a little bit my friend	0
Well were going to learn next week that its negative this also does mean minus	0
Maybe you can show me your whiteboards please	0
Listen you can check it by saying I have the letter X I have the letter Y and I have a starting number as well as a slope	0
So you have to round it using another number	0
Where	0
Alright so thats it	0
Or a rod that has length one sixth that would be the red one  in this problem would also have length two twelfths	0
Seven represents what number you divided by two	0
Find the flaw	0
The only thing your colored pencil was for is if you missed any of these because I need to be able to walk around and see what I need to help you with	0
Tomas with George	0
For example Ollie has two people in his house	0
I dont have space for this Im going to have to write to a different source	0
Okay	0
No	0
Think	0
Yeah bring them back and well just continue with that	0
Nice and loud	0
And you two remained	0
420 or 210 or 15 yes or 14 of the 45 thats left	0
So I started off with 25 and to get from 5 to 50 I multiplied by 2	0
For these ones here	0
I will know Im successful when I can justify a rule I created to get the largest quotient in a game	0
Because its so relForestt to today	0
I Apolo keep it up here	0
Okay	0
Are you all going to have thee 10 answers	0
The investigation is to find out something about these exterior angles	0
Okay so I have Julia do you normally work with Ethan	0
Okay	0
Veronica I m going to have you go to Eugene s spot for math if that s okay because I m going to keep Eugene here	0
Youre a little bit better than T and thats okay	0
Hes cut it into equal size in part B that is important	0
Youre going to do so great in something were going to do in just a little bit	0
So were going to multiply 110 by four over four	0
Oh I did that one wrong	0
Were not doing the hard side yet	0
Then youre going to go back to 231	0
Okay friends you should be done cutting these up and working	0
Lets go ahead and do number three together	0
Okay	0
Impressive	0
All right	0
Let s talk about joke of the day	0
I can clearly see your thinking here	0
Because if I know what these two sides are equal to then I know what the other sides are	0
Next to it is okay	0
You can paste them down here	0
So moving over to improper fract	0
So in this case we went to the store and we bought 10 Snickers bars the fraction onetenth as Alex just said it onetenth means that we are going to eat one out of the 10 candy bars thats why we also could call this one out of 10	0
So were all going to be musicians today	0
All right	0
Hang on one second Felix	0
Keep up the great work	0
I would like you to complete	0
So lets see if you did	0
Is there a way like that with this	0
So we have three different problems here	0
Get busy guys	0
What we are going to do today with this is You are going to write the decimals in standard form first	0
And its going to help if we look for the least common multiple	0
Because its a straight line	0
Theres one two three four five and I counted all the tenths and then I counted the ones	0
I thought we were doing the one under it	0
I want to keep doing this but we have a lot of problems	0
Yes	0
We will skip this one	0
Thank you	0
Oh yeah its that one right there	0
Okay	0
You are usually concise in your explanation	0
This is our last lesson for this quarter	0
Im sorry thank you	0
And for the righthand side it is X plus six	0
Y intercept	0
I will have to look and see how many reservations I have	0
Were dividing by three here	0
Heres Queen Arlene in her half	0
This is how youre going to tell your brain what youre up to today Using Diagrams to Find the Number of Groups	0
Well today were actually going to start looking at some of the US forms of measurement	0
Okay or two would have an arrow in your diagram going to four different ways that you could think about it	0
And so as far as in math goes thats like its not possible to have	0
That the function the y values are trapped in between negative four and zero	0
No	0
Whatever it is	0
10 seconds think time	0
Look guys in this first column its set up here	0
Put one out	0
And Noah Im going to have you join them	0
This will help me for what Im going into	0
I agree with Miller	0
It was a secret until you put it on the board	0
I just spoke to you about it	0
Write on your board just take a couple of moments of think and writing time	0
Theyre talking about ones	0
Go	0
Look at the denominator that five	0
Lets do two	0
All right	0
The axis labeled B represents the account balance in dollars	0
Partial products	0
So all you have to do is study for these practice tests and everything that Im that Im having you do	0
Because youre going to do the math right now	0
So I could write all my angles and all my sides couldnt I	0
Yeah at least she doesnt need to do eight tricks as the same amount as the dog so its basically doubled	0
So David this is 100 correct because I have three groups of four	0
They were returned	0
TRUE	0
because its wider	0
Okay and then we find one X is equal to minus six so the solution is minus six	0
Then thats not so bad	0
Im sorry	0
Because it goes up from left to right	0
Yep	0
Rob running the same distance	0
Expand those out like I did on the board please	0
Okay so think about the size of the fraction 18 and 110	0
I know	0
A five would be  I could come back and teach your next class	0
Yes	0
Example five	0
Were not going to continue this is your example	0
Yeah so youve got to make sure youre doing x and y	0
You are practicing your coordinates and playing against your playing against the computer	0
Great	0
Some of you guys are not paying attention now	0
Three times negative five is negative 15	0
Maybe	0
24 units and 30 units long	0
So like notice how this blue line goes across both of these angles	0
Thats very nice	0
No	0
Im sorry that you just barely missed joke of the day	0
That is a bargain	0
All right	0
Since the length of base doesnt change so and in between the parallel lines always	0
If you can draw a vertical line all the way around your graph and it only crosses at one point then you have a function	0
Mmmm  I added everything perfectly	0
But if we do eight plus one	0
So weve taken what we know about array and weve used it to figure out area	0
Sorry	0
So heres the way that I want you to think of this	0
Let me see if I can  No for the whole class to hear	0
So get with me here babe	0
Page 164 and 165	0
Fewer than 14	0
But I think	0
Okay	0
Line segment already has two points	0
Oh okay well keep working	0
I want another unit rate I want to know when they do one of something what happens	0
I didnt know it was US	0
You guys gotta start working better together and comparing answers	0
I got good cards	0
Um when you when youre doing the bottom line thing do you put it like 36 twice and 25 three times on the scale d or do you just put it once	0
Yes of course	0
And if we add those up we know that theyre equal	0
If I cover up this zero its 10	0
Im going to collect it	0
Okay	0
And then so	0
Then it says For every cup of white paint there are 2 tablespoons of blue paint	0
No	0
And then I divided it in half	0
Over here	0
Lets start again	0
So this answer this neg uh negative four you cannot find the answers	0
So just make sure that youre getting those Monday assignments done theyre actually a really big chunk of your grade	0
I knew that half of it twelve plus 3 equals 7 or half of 12 was 6 to six	0
Youre dividend has to be larger than your divisor or Im going to get a negative number	0
The hole doesn t have to be at the xaxis	0
Two times two times two	0
Weve done this plenty of times before	0
Okay	0
These are four other points	0
He uses a lot of brown paint	0
This point S and thats going to be at two comma negative 10	0
Two well would it be four	0
Jesse hey Jesse are you out there	0
This time Im going to work with a little small group and well have Drews mom work with a little small group on this problem then hopefully well have some steps to share	0
Are we obliged to do them both at the same time	0
Mmhmm	0
I do	0
I know the both of you do so you dont need to come	0
So if uh you certainly need to look in the heading	0
Get your whiteboards out	0
And then Ill give you a problem for you guys to try on your own	0
No I did two F and the next two	0
81	0
Eleven minus nine minus 21 and one	0
So this one is written as S A S side angle side	0
Can you can you can you bi I drew a line	0
Sorry about that everyone	0
Yeah	0
All right	0
In the top part	0
Oh I see	0
well	0
I did 10 divided by 5 and	0
Ill give you a hint	0
It doesnt go 150 times theres nothing left over	0
Well I think I would call the yellow  twenty  five  because twenty five plus twenty five  equals fifty	0
I m good	0
I read left to right	0
Two hundred and four shares so one shares eight	0
So then show me that	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
that one	0
So this is a slope of four	0
Three and four are going to do two things were multiplying fractions but I do not want you to skip these pieces	0
Now lets see if you guys can figure out what our four partial products should look like	0
Mmhmm	0
One fourth equals 312	0
You couldnt really make anything bigger than  that because it would be too hard to see	0
Now were going to look	0
Learning target isor I think already didstudents will be able to locate and graph points that contain negative numbers in a coordinate plane	0
T	0
You have a couple different sentences	0
Four	0
We have 263 total marbles inside this bucket	0
Okay	0
If you have a question just raise your hand and Ill come around and help you	0
Yeah	0
Youve got to be able to answer these questions because if you just say Its really easy its not because youre not understanding it at all the levels we want you to understand it	0
One fifth plus one half	0
You have to really try to stay focused	0
another sailboat over here	0
Perfect	0
Page 31	0
Um	0
No inaudibe	0
Now with this one its teeny so its more like counting up by that	0
If I have 13 thought I could use that paper	0
Those are even ish	0
All the groups did it this way	0
A to the M B to the M Okay	0
Friends five and seventenths is written like this	0
All right	0
Distance is the dependent variable and I would think of it in this problem as how far Jolene walked depends on how long shes been walking for	0
Our first problem says if I get to nine cups of pasta and 18 ounces of tuna	0
So just be aware of that	0
All of those are over one up two or something like that for each one	0
Last example for today	0
Tell me were going to do a little sage and scribe here	0
Were on Do you think its because these are interacting	0
Hudson	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
All right	0
Write a minimum of two paragraphs okay on what weve learned today	0
And then were going to kind of alternate between in person and online for answers for these to see what we come up with	0
22 blocks	0
You only drew a half so once again you look at the size and to be relevant	0
Okay	0
Okay so six days puts us at 18 which is almost there but they gave you the hint down here day three and a half	0
Well A squared minus two A squared	0
Okay	0
1 2 3 show your board	0
Just the left	0
Yes	0
Levi Violet and Matteo	0
This machine is very noisy up here	0
They want to know how much money he has left when hes done	0
And the QR	0
Just a minute	0
Okay were going to take 20 minutes of class time	0
Its on the poster in the pink underneath the clock	0
We have 34 hundredths and 248 thousandths	0
If youre done with the quiz or when youre done with the quiz what you need to be doing is going back and the comparison ratio problems that we were trying to upload into Schoology I had a lot more people with success with that today so I think I can help you with that	0
Thats pattern two	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
So all right lets try three	0
Last one	0
Okay	0
Okay I am seeing some confusion with the shading but thats okay lets talk about it	0
But its going to be the same exact size of pizza	0
Hope you know where they are	0
So there are 52 weeks in a year	0
Im going to use 5   10	0
Yeah	0
I cant square it	0
Cover your work please	0
Twelve	0
Yes please	0
I think you should be beyond the first paper now	0
That is exactly right on	0
So our question says when we have this multiplication here we can think of this like the word of	0
So hopefully everybody has those four points and my lines are the tiniest bit off but I think it should work anyways	0
He has two whole bananas and five half bananas	0
Okay thank you	0
99 of the time if a person doesnt know something theyre going to take some time to think about it	0
Okay thank you just making sure	0
Okay	0
Friends you lose your whiteboard privileges for the week if you cant handle them	0
Okay	0
Love it	0
Okay	0
Please turn your microphone off So I can hear Austin	0
Oh thats a good first draw I would say	0
This person gets one	0
Can you guys calm down a bit here	0
Great	0
Awesome job	0
And twosix equals 412	0
Mmhmm	0
Notice she was comparing the whole number	0
So were getting into a much more adJohnnyced math concept that fourth grade will allow	0
Thats okay	0
We cant find the mean when were looking at categorical data	0
Nothing changed about X so the width did not change but then 3 times Y got three times bigger	0
Um I played five games with my dad	0
so Mary has two friends	0
I know that some of you can do these in your head	0
Were gonna close it	0
Okay	0
Were we not supposed to do problem number two	0
You are down to 30 seconds	0
And they gave this guy one	0
What I wrote was that the cat is right with 15 and I think what the dog did was he counted up to 10 and he didnt count the other side like Oh theres ten on this side theres ten on the other side	0
And if you do not its okay because sometimes I dont understand them	0
Im going to push next before you move I want to show you where everyones going to	0
Avery	0
So here this is not saying A times zero this is say A to the zero power	0
My whole was five days	0
Yup	0
I have a question on B	0
So all you need to do is write x equals negative four per vertical line	0
The factors are the same the decimals are just in different places	0
Im going to restart it	0
When we get to were going to fill out a chart later you have an excellent strategy for figuring out fourths	0
So this Well just start with student B	0
Not everyone is imagining it	0
And 36 times three I believe it is 108	0
Im going to draw mine to look like this	0
Your basic	0
Okay	0
Eileen will you go by Miss Gibson and grab Dana and go by  and grab Derrik please	0
Youre going to try them and find out	0
Friends I do not want to see us coloring on our nails anymore	0
Theyre in the bottom numbers	0
Also if you cry I dont understand dont understand try to keep working nonetheless so that you will uh	0
You can glue this in with it	0
See look its because say you add a red or a blue you can  add a red or blue here	0
We should probably be doing what we are doing on the board	0
Thank you	0
Do you have a ruler	0
Then those friends who use their math skills to come up with common denominators to prove it you figured out that sometimes it doesnt work	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
If we plug in negative seven What would that thats not	0
Okay one two three show me your boards	0
Okay	0
Want you to go with your gut	0
Uh	0
Doesnt matter doesnt matter	0
Would be 140	0
Ill show you	0
Linear or not linear Im going to show you two different ways for each of these problems	0
Yes	0
If and only if you use subtraction then you will make it	0
Look at your number line	0
That totally works	0
Its more like how far away from the car you are	0
This is why I call people up to explain their thinking	0
No person does the same thing	0
I want to see the drawing and the answer	0
Again you may not finish this whole thing in 20 minutes but Im going to give you a 20 minute time for you to build in a five minute break	0
I dont know the correct answer but it looks like you and Connor have similar answers your denominator the common denominator is the same but the numerators that youre adding are different	0
I have two zeros in my question	0
If we drew a picture we would say Linda sold nine bookmarks	0
Yes	0
No problem	0
Thank you Nathan	0
So let s establish a few things to make sure we are in agreement about what we are talking about	0
And the last one F	0
As you work this is a team assignment today	0
I still get two in my numerator	0
The length of three sides	0
You just want to be on the camera	0
Correct so use it	0
How to think and how to look for it and think about it may be a little difficult you know	0
An improper fraction is more than a one whole and the example that Elliot gave is three halves or three over two	0
Awesome job	0
So it sounds like a lot of you could have helped this student with the what they already knew you could have helped them pretty easily to get to the right answer	0
Negative Oh yeah	0
Shade the rectangle that is 34 first and the 36 26 then find the area	0
Were going to start with a flower pattern	0
All right	0
If you dont understand this you dont understand division and you shouldnt be doing sixthgrade math if you dont understand this	0
All right	0
I hit it on the head to a tee I knew exactly how many	0
So if I look I know that this is my X coordinate	0
Were just working with the top on our warmup the rest is classwork	0
Youve got your five points	0
One persons rolling the die	0
Partner A	0
So while we both got the right answer Lauries is the smarter way to do it	0
I did not tell you to do it	0
Stay here Luke	0
Okay	0
Why do you need me over here then	0
Okay yeah I think thats a great idea	0
So were going to put two of them together though not just one	0
No I think actually you should raise it because	0
Well then theres the problem	0
Now I want all of you to see what Jessica and Andrew are  building and now you all cant come up at one time so Im  gonna if its ok with Mrs Phillips Im gonna ask you in  little groups to go up there and take a look at their model  and so um we can be able to talk about it and then some of  you maybe can look at it from where youre sitting	0
Okay	0
Now what they did is they attached that five to it which then means I have to bring that five down	0
Yeah	0
Awesome	0
But over here I want you to notice this red graph	0
Whats going to happen if you walk diagonally through a city block	0
Yes	0
Well let me get to 134	0
Cartesian plane	0
I know its  has the five	0
Im sorry please wait a minute	0
All right	0
Just a quick fist bump thats all you need to do	0
So just depends where you start	0
I am	0
Hey you guys if youre going to work on the whiteboard can you put this so they can hear what youre saying	0
Im taking the tens by the tens of ones then the ones by the tens of the ones	0
On the on the ad	0
Were going to look at six houses on Elm Street	0
It is not	0
One	0
Okay showdown	0
No	0
I dont know which group I was with	0
We have 6  1  7 and	0
All right if youre not done you need to borrow from somebody else	0
So the whole equation will have to do with this whole image you have	0
So by the end of today I want you to able to do that	0
Its cool outside	0
Three	0
Put that away please	0
Its telling me to take three thirds out to make a whole	0
So what Im going to do is Im going to put you guys in breakout rooms for about one minute	0
Excellent job my friends	0
The fewest number of blocks away the library is from the ice cream shop	0
Thats what it means right there	0
Could you do 95 equals y	0
Okay	0
Yep	0
Okay	0
It doesnt matter what order you put them in	0
Oh there is the word	0
Its not still actively bleeding but it would be good to cover it up just to keep it clean	0
But I can see by looking at this that you then decided I need to use a straight edge	0
Go to your desk	0
Yes	0
Good	0
Im going to change Z and same thing I want you to notice whats going to happen to the shape whats going to change over here	0
So y intercept is plus b at the end	0
Okay now this is a super easy way to check your work	0
So heres what I would like you to do	0
Something like that	0
seven out of 22	0
yeah okay equals 180	0
And the last one Jeff	0
Awesome	0
Okay	0
There you go	0
Okay	0
Okay so you know that apply means to put in action and I will know I have got it when I plot points and it creates an image	0
Clay is very smart and wed love to highlight that but I also want to make sure that you guys understand a couple of different strategies when youre doing shading	0
Now we get some big numbers and Ill just calculate them here because I dont  want us to spend too much time with this	0
Sometimes youre going to see it where they start with your first set of data which means they start with this number but most of the time theyll just add random numbers that are on there just for the sake of being there	0
As far as like overall points in this class go	0
Okay	0
I see two different diagrams if could be at this point	0
Well get to that in one minute	0
Fourth wedge	0
These are all words that we are going to be working on today	0
Okay	0
You might have a little bit more trouble doing this one	0
So I want you to think back to yesterday when we were drawing  when we were drawing all of these area models and we used so one third of one sixth	0
Twothirds of eight were	0
you watched a video about slope yesterday	0
Im sorry I cant hear can you stop	0
Your hands not in the air youre not paying attention or you dont belong in here	0
The numbers get really big if you cube it or you go to the fourth power fifth power or anything like that	0
I need you to pick an estimate	0
So now round 63 and 619 to the nearest yeah you have to do the grid stuff	0
Im going to listen	0
So lets say we get E here we would have to do E plus E to get our total answer	0
You can borrow mine then	0
So were not getting more middle school students	0
Talk louder	0
You are going to bring your paper without talking and come sit on the carpet	0
Starting off I want you to show a full rotation clockwise with your straws	0
Will you take your books and notebooks out in front of you and bags on the ground	0
How about 45   5  9	0
Mmhm	0
Its already added in there	0
All right next one please round to the nearest 10th	0
Be careful	0
Now in here you want to do insert image and then camera and just do the camera right in there	0
It s four because I m so smart	0
No no just a number sentence	0
Okay good	0
Im doing them in alphabetical order	0
Lets do it	0
This is like what we did yesterday	0
All right	0
Are there only supposed to be three people in a group	0
Why are we talking in accents	0
Stop	0
Yep dont move the S move the T instead	0
See a couple people who are graphing it a couple people who are writing in the table	0
Thats okay	0
Good	0
Alyssa go work with Jonathan	0
Its 6 5	0
No its okay its okay	0
Right  where the one half rod ends is where you would place one  half where it ended here he placed a one	0
But plus zero doesnt really add much to this equation	0
No more	0
Think of the way to use fractions to divide the land	0
Okay wait type it in the chat	0
The biggest one is bigger than one and the smallest one is actually in the negatives	0
For todays lesson and were nearly done	0
Go	0
Good	0
Yes	0
If its perfectly up and down youre not going to be able to walk or bike or run or whatever ski down the slope	0
No	0
Yes	0
Thank you	0
And you did the second column times three	0
Okay	0
And youre also going to do some work on the back end	0
Now well get to the last one which is letter H	0
No because the fifth person only touches every fifth sixth person every six	0
Some of you go right here	0
Start with for every	0
Yeah	0
We  have another one a half	0
Flip to the next page	0
You subtract seven and you should get 41	0
Come on guys	0
A zero because Im no longer in the value of the ones	0
Well we can get started	0
Yeah but she s not telling us she does understand or she doesn t she s just sitting there looking at me with some stupid silly grin	0
An irrelephant	0
Okay	0
Yes but If we dont know how do we figure it out	0
Um	0
s9 1827	0
And Im going to shade all of that in in the other direction	0
What Id like you all to do is instead take those pieces and just slide them down but keep them on the paper	0
Yup	0
Now  I am starting with 12 meters of ribbon	0
No	0
Maybe do 45 times 44	0
Youre going to use the colors to represent Ill help you out in a minute	0
Let me show you the instructions for this	0
You guys are working instead of listening and youre not doing this right	0
You think	0
James do you have yours	0
No	0
All right using the area model here I want you to label the picture	0
Take it off	0
Good	0
Im going to take just so I can track your strategy	0
Theyre translating very good	0
Heres six so you started at positive eight	0
Yeah you have a white so that is half of this	0
If I add these two surface areas together	0
Okay	0
Im going to give you about one more minute and that is it	0
You could use a different algorithm	0
And we have been working on two levels on the one hand we have tried to find out	0
Great work	0
And thats gonna be our last question	0
I will put it on top of the squared paper	0
One	0
You can just draw an arrow to that thats part D Okay	0
Did I add it correctly	0
Okay	0
Go	0
This is fine	0
Step 5 Repeat	0
When I call your name youre just going to stand up and grab this really quickly	0
Yessidy yes	0
the number inside you can expand it as you can calculate	0
Thats very good	0
So what were missing is that segment J I is congruent to segment IE	0
Today and tomorrow were going to take what we know and just briefly just a little bit expand the bubble of knowledge	0
Okay	0
Guys side talking needs to stop even if you think this is the easiest thing in the world	0
Thanks everybody	0
Not yet	0
Now I have to subtract this three fourths from this up here	0
So you could say that we are going to determine	0
We have	0
Plugging in my iPad	0
Good job you guys	0
How much does something cost how many of it do I need	0
Yeah its supposed to be 13	0
Brogan Im moving you down a little bit you and Maggie or Abby are awful close	0
Lets do one more proposal up here	0
Okay	0
Anyway so you know about these and I want us to know that they are  there and just kind of think that these numbers go on and on but the numbers were  studying right now   Were studying numbers that are not the whole numbers necessarily  but could be	0
And that is seventyseven point one seventyseven point one centimeters	0
I will be right there	0
solve the problem	0
The slanted line	0
Youll use her as for today so shell do that	0
Lets look at our ratios	0
Open up your spirals to a clean page today	0
I just taught you	0
You were going to say two and four but that ones not taken	0
Tell me why you said a half	0
What did you do	0
There were	0
What happened	0
Hmm	0
Two	0
Should we have to guess what youre doing today	0
Yes	0
Oh yeah	0
So theyre just saying one unit for us	0
So when you hear that word of the day that means impractical youre gonna head to your desks	0
Good	0
So based on my Hundredth grid I have 38	0
Now let me blow your mind with this next piece	0
Think about real world situations where you use multiplication	0
Excellent	0
Im hungry today	0
otherwise each element of the addition will divide up	0
You guys I need you to engage	0
Okay	0
Break those into thirds Landon	0
Three wholes	0
So they just notice these are exactly the same y equals two times three plus one f of three is two times three plus one all its telling you is that youre replacing x with three	0
Lets check it out	0
Please for just a minute let me clarify something	0
Okay	0
It sounds like Hannah bringing up the best strategy kind of brought it up out of everyones memory	0
14 is over here 10 is up here	0
Because if you have a whole which is 100 and you take 25 of that it would be 25 from 100	0
I would do	0
Were talking about thirds because we understand 34	0
Okay so think about that	0
Don t write anything yet because we re done with our whiteboards for right now	0
Im sorry thats why Im thinking	0
You actually have to write the number story after your conversation	0
Stop being ahead of	0
Weve got two random selections coming up here in a minute	0
Thats a real good question for both of you to think about	0
A cubed times B cubed	0
You just got me into the hundreds	0
three thirds	0
Thank you	0
I know Im sorry I really am but I hope maybe Mrs Phillips  will let you work on this tomorrow and aT2ually finish  writing up what youre doing and describing it for Monday	0
What do you do once youre done	0
Thats going to lead us to todays lesson	0
okay I hope that everyone had enough time to at least share some ideas about what they thought prime and composite meant	0
Shorten it	0
So 8 goes into 1 zero times	0
No	0
So you do need to fill this in	0
Okay	0
Hey guys to be able to find somebodys mistake thats a much higher level problem good job	0
So thats a five game series	0
This one minus this one	0
Okay when you are done please come back to the floor with your books	0
Yes that works too	0
So it looks like its probably going to be the same for the other one	0
So you may you know you may all think about this initially differently and then you share your thinking	0
And then I would subtract out to get my answer	0
So this one 20 5 and then you look to your numerator and youve got to remember that you have to multiply what by whatever is there	0
All right	0
Yes	0
Asymptote	0
Okay	0
Yes well really I just wanted you to draw the relationship and just think about	0
Okay	0
Okay go ahead on A divide it into thirds	0
So I knew it was four	0
Thank you for coming right back to t carpet	0
Thats what youre looking at	0
Check your work here please	0
Yeah	0
Number four	0
Okay Antonio is still staying healthy pretty much staying pretty healthy at least	0
No you subtract two in your rule you always talk about subtracting two	0
Okay Im going to push you	0
Impressed	0
See what shape was shaded and put it in your area model	0
Okay	0
All right	0
Is it the same formula	0
Ok	0
I think that Mariah really understands how to multiply fractions which is awesome	0
I wouldnt recommend trying to draw those every time though	0
Ill come around and	0
Be strategic with how youre canceling these out four Pi on the right side cancels out	0
Thats why theyre telling us units	0
How to simplify the lefthand side how to simplify the righthand side	0
Id say probably I	0
I thought more of you would know what pita bread was	0
Horizontal	0
Were all waiting for you	0
Yeah youre good	0
All right	0
The maintenance team failed and we didnt take the	0
Blackboard	0
I think its true because theres one more tenth for 53 and one less tenth for 5289	0
So if I draw 6789 circle the twos	0
Okay	0
Renee	0
Continue please	0
Its this line right here	0
Something that Eileen has connected to her background knowledge is the relationship between fractions and division	0
So you did Let me think	0
34ths	0
If I give you a decimal I want you to give me a fraction	0
And it could make more	0
Its just a number	0
We have a variety of answers here	0
Wait why is there a missing  the homework here	0
Is this right	0
Maybe a little before that	0
here and here and  to here	0
And realize weve already done a problem just like this except that had numbers in it	0
I want you to notice what this pattern is its the pattern of squares so two times two is four thatd be your next point	0
Alan Im talking to Dave	0
Yeah	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
No this will be this will become one equation	0
I um I was sick yesterday so I dont have 12 through 19	0
Then penta	0
Who else	0
Actually can you	0
You would take this guy times this guy and you would take this guy times this guy and at the next step I no longer have fractions	0
Well you dont use it in  We use the remainder	0
If youre in the first row youre going to spin around and form a group of four with the second round	0
You know what I dont need your sass	0
So	0
So its about 100 newspapers	0
Its the same thing as going over two up by three just smaller steps	0
I just need to do	0
inaudible because 900ths and 009 And 09 to 09 is nine is 100 Is 90 And 009 is just like 9	0
Okay my friends I am going to show you something	0
No 400 times 5	0
I see Connor	0
Okay	0
One two three four five times as many	0
What	0
with you remember that	0
Oh because	0
Excellent	0
I dont want you to think about any of the past  stuff weve been working on today	0
So here  Stop let me explain that	0
All right Paulina	0
I want you to use this as a tool today	0
Then Im going to go over the second question with you just so were really clear about being able to solve it accurately	0
Yes	0
Make sure the coordinates you give me are six away	0
We have 19 students	0
the rocks	0
We are live	0
One my job isnt always as easy as it seems and two thats what I want you to start doing with your teams	0
Please remember if you got some scissors from Stephen if Stephen gives you scissors please remember that he did because those are Mr Carloss and hes going to need those back	0
Good job	0
If I have to call it your name	0
Go ahead Im sorry	0
So lets come back to the shared screen and just watch me do it	0
Lets look at thirds	0
Some of you might notice that I put a little device at the corner of your desk	0
Look underneath that	0
I know	0
Both mean the same	0
One point two to the eleventh power divided by one point two to the ninth power	0
Once again dont just do it because Mr Parker said so	0
My friends math is over	0
Plus one point five gives us twentyfive point five	0
The one represents how many pieces we do have	0
I want you to think to yourself which of these norms youre going to focus on today	0
Lets write	0
I think pencil extend those lines like that	0
Now this is where its really important	0
Ok right	0
Right so negative	0
One and 918	0
When  we call the orange and red one	0
I did minus four X	0
I dont know the units	0
So you guys either be in math class and participate today	0
Then were gonna talk about domain and range	0
30	0
There s three thirds so there s two  thirds and one third and one third that s two thirds and you  still have one two thirds left over	0
Then I did 7 times 50 which we all said was 350	0
We have some agreement  here	0
You got it so now we have 80 East fans 120 West fans if there were 200 people watching again its the assumption is that the ratio stays the same	0
Two X	0
Yes	0
Like if you had six times zero it says that youre not multiplying anything  zero	0
Theres three places	0
We only have 48 eggs a month	0
But youre not doing a lot of work off to the side cause you want to make this efficient	0
Its a square pizza	0
Okay so those sides are equal these sides are parallel	0
Try that number one	0
And Im going to share my screen with you so I can draw	0
Okay were back from break	0
Okay you and your partner two people	0
All right	0
Like this	0
Yes	0
Thank you	0
So when Im working on a response Is number five for today For a constructive response	0
So this is like how weve been talking about equations when 0x doesnt really add anything y is always three	0
Okay	0
Nice job	0
So	0
12	0
People you can close your computers Ill just wait till I see every computer is closed	0
I really appreciate the effort you put in for me today	0
I know because if you look at the 910  right then youll see that its a 8 and requires	0
Bless you	0
Just a minute	0
Then I would put 21 hundredths 22 hundredths 23 hundredths  24 hundredths	0
Okay so B  use the fractions you wrote in part A to write three fractions equivalent to 45	0
Thank you Danielle	0
Brandon please do the warmup	0
X2 Y2 if you want	0
I want hands and thumbs not mouth	0
And Im going to make them kind of smaller so everybody gets a chance to share	0
Okay	0
Im gonna do the mini lesson on writing the differences because its the exact same as writing your similarities	0
Im going to need a helper	0
You got it	0
No youre working on math boxes alone	0
One half of three one half of three fourths	0
Hum um we do	0
Thats the important part	0
One two three four five six seven eight	0
So hers is actually more legible than mine	0
Then if you buy eight 70yen pears then seven times eight equals 560 yen	0
Hey its crooked	0
Nine point six eight eight three	0
Midpoint your first point is X1 plus X2 over two	0
If I do No this would be 282	0
I dont understand where shes getting the number thirteen from	0
Did you know that	0
To our list up there Im just going to also add that we can use colon or we can use a to in the middle	0
Right okay	0
Youre making a graph please	0
Theres a lot of different things you can do	0
The big trick to partial products or to multiplication wrestling is to pay attention to where your numbers are and really keep things organized	0
So just gonna cross this out	0
Dont talk to the board the board doesnt care	0
Instead Im taking it and dividing it into four	0
Wait Penny is not up with us yet	0
And then divide	0
Hafiga how many cards do you have	0
on here we got six quick practice questions	0
Its the part	0
Its not the same for Y value	0
And I just need to take half of that which brings us to one very good	0
Let me show you how I did it heres the singing 4 performers 3 hours 16 an hour	0
All right	0
Oh no	0
Okay go for it crew	0
Okay so for number one okay so for number one heres how Im going to recommend	0
We have 32 and then when we add together our fractions we have 4136 but thats an improper fraction	0
Uhhuh	0
Every time you press Send thats a text	0
Then give me your number model with your unknown	0
I want everyone to listen to this	0
Is it about what polygraphs are	0
So like why did that hammer show up	0
No one is across from me	0
Yes	0
I made some sort of math	0
Okay so like I said this is going to be a quick lesson because we this should be a review from third grade	0
Try just try	0
This is the context	0
Okay	0
So want to see that	0
Okay	0
Once I had half and then I flip that in half again	0
And then I could go down here do a text box	0
Wait hold on before we do if you have one of these markers on your desk press the on button just to turn it on	0
The peloton thing is a big deal right now huh	0
Last one people	0
Okay last one	0
So whats colored in is pretty big	0
Tuna	0
Objectives are this	0
Right	0
Barbara is right	0
And in case nobody laughs This is what I added trick day	0
Okay so here are some reminders and announcements for you and then well kind of be well finish hopefully a couple minutes early	0
Actually why dont you come back here bring up a chair stay here with this group to make it simple	0
Doubled the size	0
Yes	0
So the rise is two	0
You would just write No no no no	0
Okay	0
All right	0
Yes it works	0
Theres nobody else to touch it	0
And then I do also just want to point out so like this person put dollar signs in the table	0
Hey girl vertical line show that it goes through both points	0
So up until this point when weve done ratios weve compared parts to parts or wholes to wholes	0
Okay	0
It didnt put the four	0
Okay I see some heads nodding	0
Oh yes then it is party time	0
Think about different ways I can show one	0
You can grab those and get started now	0
All right so Ill have everyones homework that did not do it	0
That would probably be helpful	0
Number two was a little tricky	0
So if you know the radius of a sphere then you know this is the volume and surface area	0
This should be zero four zero three zero negative 2 zero negative four	0
Yeah	0
Thats right	0
Okay	0
And remember on Friday our learning intention was that we could come up with the relationship between multiplication and division	0
All right	0
Im almost done passing stuff guys	0
Okay	0
All right open all rooms	0
I just want to talk a little bit about the trapezoid first	0
All right	0
You know what you may get your snacks	0
Yeah mm hmm	0
Again youre going to have a stack that looks like this	0
I wouldnt have thought to do this in my head	0
No wait	0
First thing okay she multiplied 10 times four	0
Do I keep working	0
Uh huh	0
And for now I have placed some hint cards up here so people who want to refer to this can refer to it	0
Namely four rightangled triangles in the one board and four rightangled triangles in the other board	0
Great job	0
You used a specific value	0
You may skip anybody remember how many problems	0
Lets keep going	0
Wait do I press	0
Mhmm	0
Oh really	0
Tomorrow	0
Okay	0
One two three	0
So to go through the steps of this this is what they want you to do	0
Five by three	0
How many pounds of meat did he buy in all	0
Okay	0
In this case apparently you can be in at  now	0
The tick mark part yes	0
Okay	0
So ask yourself that question before	0
Yes	0
O	0
So on here if you have claimed if you put your initial on more than one of these like or more than a half so like if you have two thirds here you get a point for that	0
Red	0
Well it goes all the way to 16	0
Tada	0
Vick thats not for you	0
Okay Michael	0
In order to know side angle side we need to know that this is congruent to this	0
Addition the order doesnt matter	0
SS right	0
Michael wheres your camera	0
You got it	0
Im going to call on three people to come up and hold up their boards like this	0
Jack those are all wrong	0
Okay heres your next one	0
My next line is and you guys I count as I go so that I dont do it again	0
There we go	0
Our remainder is we have 3 out of 5 needed so our answer 7 35 matches 7 35	0
Its one and three	0
See how easy that is	0
Theres all of these its easiest to use points that cross right in the middle rather than points that cross like partway through	0
Excellent Martin	0
Actually Im going to do it a little bit differently	0
Oh whoa thats pretty good	0
There yes	0
Not possible	0
No you have to go up maybe	0
Okay	0
Yep	0
I heard someone say I finished it while you were teaching	0
We came up with a diagram with a bunch of numbers and equations on it	0
I dont know what youre playing with but I would stop before I come over there and take whatever it is away	0
When you said that I was gonna say Oh I respectfully disagree	0
So I can look at what you said	0
Yup	0
That wasn t what he was  focusing on but I think suppose changed this suppose we took this  story and made it a math problem	0
So this means if you want to go from your x values to your y values you take the x value and you multiply it by negative two and then you add nine	0
172	0
Now pay attention to the blackboard	0
Okay now you and your eagle partner are coming up with a real world situation and writing a real world problem for a half of six	0
Now first day one	0
They said To solve this problem I divided 47 divided by six therefore I know 47 divided by six equals seven and 56 because of the question	0
You multiplied it once	0
Finish your coloring	0
That makes sense	0
are the numbers the monkeys	0
No	0
12 of 3	0
Under what circumstances can	0
so we are going to try this	0
Dont we have 35 students	0
27  13	0
This one is four comma zero and youre realizing oh well x is always equal to four	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Very good	0
We are calling that a half because anything past the line is one and whatever	0
Its not really that important	0
Charles is not well	0
Good	0
But youve done it right here	0
Keep going	0
Beep beep	0
Okay and thats your slope	0
Its asking you to understand vocabulary my loves	0
Notice it doeSt you get rid of it	0
So crew this is what I want you to do at the bottom of page 58 you have some room	0
Yes though	0
Thirtyfive	0
Let me ask you to do something here that might help me	0
Collin Rebecca Laura	0
Okay	0
Not even close	0
Harper Gabe just go with	0
Oh some cool mental math strategies we need to talk about	0
Miller we are estimating	0
Okay	0
How do we do it oh I figured it out	0
Lets try this again real quick	0
But if you flip this triangle down youre going to get e d f edf like that	0
Yes	0
Can you look at me	0
Youre rounding it to the nearest tenth	0
You can just turn around but you actually have to do the work first	0
True for number one	0
And I want you to physically be able to visualize	0
When our numerators are the same then we need to look at our denominators the bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces	0
Jefferson and Finely Im going to have you guys respond to my next question	0
But if you see people write money that way that means one cent	0
Wait is that how you do three	0
Ive written it here	0
Could you look up here real quick	0
Now what you are actually doing in this problem is you are finding a part of a part	0
Ones decimals tenths hundredths	0
So you might see some pictures	0
You need to buy ten	0
Okay	0
So these bars I feel like I need to make them really big or I dont know maybe I should draw them darker	0
I know you listen to mine ring a million times	0
We want to know what is 35 times four	0
In my head Im thinking Okay each bag of marbles can be multiplied	0
We re not gonna play tricks on  each other	0
Lets go back to six since were here	0
And used 10 gallons of gas	0
I would like you to calculate	0
Yes	0
The whole number 18	0
Good	0
Then I added in I got one and a half	0
Divide	0
And  what my rule does to number five it does some things to it and  what comes the result	0
Now nobody thinks its a half just because I said it wasnt	0
Thats 95	0
Wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute	0
Did you double click it	0
Good job	0
Today were going to start with a problem with some addition and hold on my stuff got out of order here today day two here we go	0
This is not included in the examples of your textbook	0
Theres no  need to do	0
250	0
Be careful	0
You have six of something	0
Theyre equivalent	0
You change the attendance here	0
Theres 5 People	0
You you should help him because you discussed it together	0
Thats a great way to put that	0
And Im just going to show you even if you if you dont have as long as you have a piece of paper you can do this like on your homework or whatever	0
Thats amazing	0
31 2	0
It goes from zero feet to 15 feet in 10 minutes	0
Not yet	0
Okay	0
We are then going to operate with these placeholders or as we learned before variables	0
Sometimes theres an extra person left	0
You will get the rest of it	0
Good enough	0
This is how you use the table	0
You dont have to calculateAlright show me	0
And get ready	0
Told you	0
This one has no donation 2 donation 5 donation	0
Okay heres what Im gonna do	0
Okay	0
Number four	0
No that cant be it	0
Did you have fun	0
Everybody move your thumb to the correct answer	0
Im not telling you youre wrong	0
I can do this	0
Oh but how can we do 11  no we didnt have to come up with how many feet	0
Okay so just a second	0
Sean come on	0
Wheres your eyes be as she shares	0
Sarah you are going to work with Franc AJand Georgia are going to work together	0
Guys do reasonable fractions	0
Youve got both pieces so youve got	0
So I go from 17 wholes to one and seven 10ths to now one more 17 100ths	0
Bless you	0
Okayfour times y four times 19	0
They are definitely getting harder	0
Don t sound so sharp	0
If not you change it	0
You have some of the right parts in there	0
And we did some examples with function notation	0
Yeah	0
Keep going	0
Do you want us to solve it in partial quotients or us traditional	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
So 6  8 and that would give us 14 for our final answer	0
You get a credit in your bank account to give you credit for having that money	0
10ths 10ths	0
Let s take a look and see what he s  doing there	0
I dont want your hand up when you	0
Other option	0
All right	0
You do	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Youre a clever girl	0
You could have done it that way and is a lot faster somewhat	0
Im sorry buddy I did not tell you this	0
I tried to make it as beautiful as possible	0
And just start uh first on E 12 start on E 12	0
Now youre breaking these down A times A times A	0
Thanks Esme	0
Borrow	0
Its 80 divided by 10	0
It gets me pretty close	0
Because each day in a week theres seven days in a week and she sells four a day	0
Okay so that is it for today	0
No	0
We want to get one of those values to one	0
Another strategy would just be I think Ive heard some of you say that you knew that half of 22 equals 22 divided by two which is 11	0
All right	0
They use numbers instead of words	0
Yeah	0
These are my factors	0
We all agree on how that works	0
Yes exactly	0
Five	0
So think about measurement	0
Its going to get what it needs to get	0
I  just couldnt stay away	0
So thats one two three and 14	0
So thats really good	0
So 2965 plus 747 it is not okay for you to go	0
Five sixth yes correct	0
Make sure theyre nice and big	0
You go to the point	0
Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top	0
No	0
Yes	0
Yes	0
And so she would have three groups of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7	0
That was my bad	0
I thought it was police station	0
Okay so 01 we have the graph is just the diagonals	0
Okay	0
Take your points you want them to be the same distance	0
Haha yes	0
So lets just stick with the easier ones for now but its a good question	0
Good job	0
And Jackie	0
So here is one group of four and then two groups of four	0
Just private think time	0
Two yellows	0
I did the ice cream	0
What I wanted you to remember is that he had two rabbits and he bought four more	0
Just hold it	0
Yours friends	0
All three	0
Oh my goodness	0
What an awkward number but never mind	0
Come back here so I can talk to you about it	0
Its forbidden weve seen	0
After you write your data from least to greatest its a good idea to count how many total data values you have	0
Surfboards	0
Lets put  this on the table I think	0
It has A through I	0
1 2 3	0
I could	0
Well before you do that you might want to start dividing it out	0
Whats in the parentheses is being cubed	0
Show how you decided where to place the cards to build the largest fraction	0
The 87 is our whole number so when it says look at the whole number were looking at the three	0
Okay lets look at the voting	0
That means that you dont need a whiteboard or a marker	0
Colton face this way	0
How am I going to estimate this first one its a 12We knew that it was closer to 10 and we knew that 19 was closer to two so 10x1	0
I think its one and a half because I took two minus one and I got one	0
But this was actually this was a perfect segue into what were gonna be talking about	0
Because right there would have told Josh I made a mistake I made a mistake	0
Awesome	0
Let us see what Meredith is doing here	0
Crew finish up your thought then you put your Chromebook at a 45 degree angle please	0
Let s see if we agree on them	0
No worries	0
Weve got it	0
Okay	0
QuicklyOK	0
We need to know how many chaperones they will need	0
Atoms	0
One two zero	0
We did it everybody	0
Its two weeks they would spend twice as much	0
And Im going to break them up into two smaller rectangles	0
Okay	0
But also think about it logically like you have one two maybe this is I dont know you cant really see it	0
There we go	0
Okay so no not until we teach math	0
Every time x goes up by one y goes up by four	0
Yeah	0
He was gone	0
No dont do it at the same time	0
Lets see by voting	0
I havent seen that happen yet	0
Its asking you to limit it to 1000 yen all together	0
So thats just negative two	0
Now you ve made the top number bigger	0
Only one theyre going to touch 13	0
Okay	0
All right can anybody tell me maybe you can unmute for this	0
I put the numbers down and carried them	0
You did	0
Can I ask you a question	0
The third point is two comma five	0
Now write well everybody calculate your calculations	0
Its five questions	0
Then you have one divided by 23	0
Everyone should be watching this	0
Who are you working with	0
Okay	0
So I drew nine three seven	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
So girls you can sit down now	0
Okay	0
Then this mathematical expressions um the solution	0
Those were your two modes	0
No we ve spent more money than them	0
What Havens doing is something that will happen sometimes	0
I am interested in the way  you re thinking about it	0
Your first ordered pair is at zero rides	0
You are going to be cutting out one	0
the numerator are the same	0
So we have two people  and theyre going to make a big batch of this	0
What did he do	0
I just used those to find out Because then I could put the purple pieces over them to see like Because it was a perfect match if I put that and there was room left for the purple	0
Now that phrase that I just said is going to show up on my work log and thats just going to just be bad	0
I appreciate that	0
Okay friends	0
Okay	0
They are faster	0
You get to decide	0
The idea from last time	0
Yeah	0
Excellent	0
I didnt see it	0
We had created a picture with a larger book	0
So check it	0
Go to page 176	0
I remember that	0
Nice one Jolene	0
Awesome	0
So just read it carefully but in this case we could have done it either way	0
And if you bisect it the prefix the prefects by means two	0
Right	0
Thank you	0
Last time you understood four hundred	0
So you dont have to write anything	0
I want to make sure your names are on the paper	0
Just to make me feel a little bit better	0
I dont want you to write it though	0
Uhhuh	0
You would start with thirds	0
And then Ill present present from here	0
Then I filled them in with dots going left to right until I got 56	0
Good	0
No flaw in that argument	0
A couple of days ago we glued things into our social studies notebook with glue sticks	0
On the other hand there are two X	0
So calculate and fill out the correct answer bigger than smaller than equal	0
That	0
But you do you know for sure that these three points are there	0
X is 38	0
You are saying that thirtyfour is what it is the number of rods	0
Twentythree	0
You have too many tabs open I think	0
Or your teacher see if you can trick us	0
So Laura  you have that method but just make sure you can explain how to do it	0
This is mugs hat up here	0
Yeah we got blue	0
Okay	0
And the statement six plus eight equals eight	0
Im up to 15 I need some more responses	0
Because these three are ones that have an  a 1 added on	0
And measure of angle three equals 180	0
The second part of this is like taking puzzle pieces apart and putting them back together	0
This ones linear	0
So let me show you on my journal	0
So  Brian you cant imagine but thats a good way of doing  it so you could all imagine the length of a meter stick	0
I like to do it as but sometimes there are some really good opportunities	0
Nine hundredths	0
Dont be afraid to draw yourself a picture about what you think is happening here	0
Your openresponse is	0
If we look at this fraction we have 13  29	0
Good	0
we know that a B is x squared plus x so Im going to write it here x squared plus x	0
Wow look at that	0
What SS are you in	0
Okay its not 25	0
Write it down somewhere	0
Here we go	0
Only crossing once at all of these spots	0
Solve	0
So so well Marcos thinking and hes trying this out	0
Very good	0
But thats okay	0
So each of these if you so if I took one of those I put 13 here 13 here 13 here and 13 here	0
And I will say about 15	0
Write that down what you said you think it is	0
This is what we went wrong last time or what I learned	0
Like how do you do X and Y	0
Will you guys talk to your neighbor about whether you think she wrote down the ordered pairs correctly or not	0
Hudson youre welcome	0
Good	0
So if you started with a Y value you end with that same Y value	0
Okay	0
Youre going to take that	0
It only works if those are If those are parallelokay great question	0
Itll give us 18 and it will give us 26 which is 13 plus 13 or 13 times 2	0
checkmarks 15 students that are ready	0
Two to the first power equals two squared is four cubed is eight times two is 16 which is the fourth power	0
Were talking surface area	0
And then Id like you to graph this	0
Yes we could have	0
Heres a sample of response	0
Add them all together	0
Good job	0
Give me one more minute	0
Thats important	0
Because 1000 is 10 times bigger than the 10	0
Usually when you graph you should label it	0
I think you can	0
Ive never had tuna before	0
Youll present it to me tomorrow in claStudents	0
Okay	0
Do not even look at those problems yet	0
Im not going to tell you the rule	0
Let me get rid of that	0
Aiden youre not talking while Im talking	0
A pyramid is a poly	0
You start solving this thing start solving this problem	0
My eight player is wrestling A and B	0
Yes I am	0
Its a negative slope	0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12	0
So there are three different objects that we are going to use to help us understand what geometry is and make some sense of it	0
But this can kind of guide and almost help you come to a different conclusion based off of what they found	0
Oh in	0
We were trying to figure out what  sort of happens in between and just as we said these keep on going and there are  infinitely many what we are going to be learning over the next maybe six or seven years  of math that even in between zero and one there are also infinitely many numbers	0
Put your whiteboard down your dry erase marker down out of your hands look up at the board	0
It says and three teaspoons of food coloring	0
We will make a small table	0
So Julia was not sure what to do	0
Okay	0
Its also known as the preimage	0
is right	0
Grabbed my hair and whipped around	0
The the angle up the top	0
Parker Im going to have you come right here	0
So this is a linear function like we discussed the slope or rate of change is minus five	0
Well well we could make another model to show that	0
Okay so a kite crosses at 90 degrees	0
Okay	0
Oh he told me to use the slash	0
I think its easier to make than the pizzas	0
Okay and you keep going up by a third	0
You can do ST Math or you can do EM4	0
If you put 90 that would become more	0
Okay	0
Then what I would like you to do is to scale it up	0
And then two plus one is three	0
Alright so there are two different ways that were going to talk about triangles being congruent today	0
Yes very good	0
If I go over here I dont know that I dont know that I dont know that I dont know	0
Four point zero	0
Here is why I agree with one	0
You got it	0
The numbers on the outsides are what you roll on each of the die	0
Miss can I	0
Missing some people from the Pear Deck too	0
Five ten fifteen  twenty twenty five thirty thirty five forty  forty five fifty	0
You have um come across the linear relationships within several things	0
The 17 is the entire distance from this tip of the triangle to this tip of the triangle	0
I have a better one but I cant find it	0
Each except you could do two things	0
Okay nice job	0
Yeah yeah	0
Step three is to subtract	0
I think Im just not understanding your  language	0
Not a circle	0
Okay	0
And the reason it cant be 21 is Im not multiplying the whole by that seven	0
Oh good you counted by two s	0
Yeah	0
So thats the first way you could say down one over two	0
Yes so if you double the first one you dont need to even look over here	0
Miss Leia is now the Mr Parker	0
So your cameras will need to be on you will need to write your answers and number them or you know write down what it is that youre doing	0
Where is there that loud banging noise coming from	0
One fourth one whole fourth	0
Um Lia you said you disagree	0
Where it goes through well it goes this way and afterwards at the lower line it continues that way	0
And I would say stand up stretch drink some water use the restroom if you need and were going to meet back here at 229	0
Maybe that third step of taking 350  300 because this is really 300 right here	0
And Im going to go to the next number	0
No	0
So for example one times four is four plus three is seven	0
Remember the first one I gave you the x	0
So what Ill do is Ill draw my sample	0
108	0
like youd walk there you buy something really quick and come back but that totally works	0
Okay	0
Okay turn your cameras on	0
You need to	0
No Hudson	0
Thats why my stomach hurts	0
I think what Meredith was trying to do is giving us	0
It should be seven otherwise its not linear which well see when we get to that one	0
You have all of the complete information up here	0
Some of you counted up how many one  third meter lengths there were	0
Theres four others	0
Go	0
I like how you did that	0
Lets put some M equal at the beginning of this	0
One then two wait hold on	0
Um	0
It killed me because I didnt know how to do it	0
All right	0
Oh what happened here	0
One more explanation	0
Not for this	0
All right so lets take a look at some basic ones	0
This is easy	0
Okay	0
Okay let me show you what your task is today	0
Okay	0
Its a little much thumbs down I wasnt listening to a thing you said and I have no idea what Im doing because its my own fault	0
Thats 12	0
The cashier wants to use the least number of bills when she gives the girls change and has only 10 and 1 bills	0
Would you guys go to the library and copy this for me	0
Yes	0
Youre going to go in Maddies group	0
S	0
You had three different ways of looking at it	0
So thats a 10	0
You find the average	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
then we ought to write an English statement at the end of it so we should say something like the first person gets 50 and the second	0
Problem numbers three and four	0
Make sure you answer the questions at the end	0
Mmhmm	0
Youre doubling the points which is great	0
Hm	0
I have to write mine up here because I might	0
Like your birthday just like 2005	0
Im going to start down the middle	0
So she had 6	0
So lets write our division sentence	0
Perfect	0
We asked ourselves  some questions about models	0
16 26 36 46 56	0
Okay	0
Its gross	0
You could go 123456789 10 11 12 and then I have 13	0
Well say X	0
Im seeing a lot of hands in the air	0
Okay so thats going to be brand new for everybody	0
One thing I forgot to say Cynthia give me five	0
Number lines they show things in order just like we are talking about in reading with sequencing things in order	0
Oh great job	0
Lets do it step by step	0
Okay	0
The number I got was 28	0
A whole what	0
Okay	0
We need to know how many oranges are in this pile	0
Basically we have a 30 60 90 triangle here	0
You guys know who Im talking about	0
Thats how we know we can divide by three	0
Penny please stop	0
I said For example  three sixth you multiply the denominator two times six equal 12 then you  numerators one times three equals three and then	0
Then  or you could have Team A win the  win one game and Team B win the other	0
So sentence two says there are 3 tablespoons of oil for every cup of tomato sauce	0
Chris let me take a look at your table for three	0
A hundred thousand	0
So thats good	0
Good	0
So 90 plus 58 is 148	0
Okay um were gonna were gonna have about three or four more minutes and were going to come back as a class	0
Good but did it in different ways	0
There you go	0
Agree	0
How are we doing back here people	0
Because 3 take away 6 is three or its a negative three	0
We made three different really good arguments	0
He ate 12 carrots and Ella ate 11 carrots	0
Conjecture is This is what I think and the argument is Heres why	0
Yes	0
A red on top	0
So when I say the rule over and over again find a common denominator we do so because the pieces are not the same size	0
I want to know if your drawings match and I want you to explain what you each did because I have to know whos right and whos wrong and I need to figure out how youre going to figure that out	0
That would make it sixthirds if that was there but its not	0
Yeah lets draw a picture	0
Nice job on that one	0
And instead of dealing with shapes were going to deal with dinosaurs	0
Okay	0
There is part of it on 52 youre right	0
Okay	0
Just randomly put in three numbers and see what you come up with for X	0
We think about where that fence is	0
Im doing all the multiples of four if you haven t figured this out yet	0
Come back to your shared screen	0
type in the chat	0
Were going to count seven groups of five are you ready five 10 15 20 25 30 35	0
inauidble There ya go	0
Good	0
Make sure your user names in there	0
I wanna know about the inscribed angle theorem the right angle corollary and the arc intercept corollary	0
You have to start from somewhere	0
Two through five on page 164	0
All right so today we are working on strategies for choosing partial quotients	0
Shh	0
Its in the middle	0
I just knew 4 4 times is	0
Okay theres four	0
That means that 4 yurts could hold 24 people	0
Do it your way and see if you come up with the same answer	0
I think this is a good thing to talk about	0
Lets start with box number zero which was the most shallow box	0
I remember	0
If you sit around the room please take one of the talking things with you	0
Six is less than the number	0
Before we start we just need to get our brains going	0
Two	0
Thank you	0
So when you get into Schoology if its been open youre going to have to refresh but I just closed it	0
Right	0
Money is a realworld context	0
Remember youre thinking of the largest dividend the smallest divisor so you can get the largest quotient	0
Stop	0
So we have been solving model number stories	0
I was going to say 11 but its definitely 10	0
Unit three they did pretty good they got an 80 and an 80	0
If you multiply by more than 1 your product is more	0
Okay todays the start of our twoday lesson	0
So theres 28 there now	0
You have the area	0
Yes	0
Thats what youre trying to figure out	0
Were going to also look at this second part which is finding areas by subdividing	0
Okay	0
These are our cards	0
Chandler turn your camera on	0
I just noticed that there were some people having trouble on that	0
Thats right	0
Look at all the fancy mathematics youre  doing thats amazing	0
All right	0
Thats right here	0
Okay	0
So if I break it out I have 10 and two 40 and eight	0
Using this	0
Ok	0
Okay	0
First of all figure out the estimate so the second root of six second root of six	0
But now I realize that I could just take 75 cents away from three and added them to get 525	0
Thats right	0
A quiz	0
Okay I think I got that	0
Let s give Mason a power clap one two three clap	0
Okay	0
Seven times nine is 63 plus five is 68 and Im going to add that up	0
Awesome	0
What is the fewest number of blocks Ben will have to walk to get to the grocery store	0
Youre going to love this then	0
Sentence four or I guess sentence three Emanual	0
It would	0
I dont know	0
What would you be painting with milliliters do you think	0
Thank you	0
8751	0
Yes I need to make that a little bit smaller	0
You re just going side to side	0
With the rods you had available not able to cut  them or make them different	0
Front row can you take one scooch back	0
Theres six points each	0
So now my divisor my dividend has gone from 825 to 75	0
Um yeah I mean like I had made plans with someone else but they never texted me the entire day	0
So see you get the penalties	0
Youve got on only one side with Xs	0
So if you are looking for 10 of a number youre exactly right	0
Show me when its done and then you may go back to play your game	0
so here we go	0
Unlike  Ms Strathom lost her thing	0
Maybe that has part of the purpose	0
Pedro looked at these four fractions and said Oh	0
You got your green sheets	0
I think I think Jacquelyn and Kelly have a  hard one	0
Yeah	0
Herve said where I divide first then after you have 15 quarters with 11 quarters	0
Im going to take care of it thank you	0
So let me finish Terrance	0
Im going to write this over here because thatll be easier for me to add	0
It means you take away five from all your Y values	0
So for example lets start up here	0
At 1000 its like Meh	0
Weve done this a little bit before when we were comparing different juice drinks but were going to look at some different situations today	0
Yes	0
We know that if we set fivetenths equal to something over a hundred we can find out the equivalent fraction with this denominator	0
Just like we did yesterday	0
I know	0
Those multiplications signs mixing with those Xs	0
Thats all you had to do	0
Wait so we can do an improper right	0
You can cover mistakes	0
Okay	0
5	0
All right go	0
So you have your 12 dollars plus the 2 that you spent for the 2 movies	0
Yes	0
Yeah	0
Finish up that page	0
Were going to do math message	0
All right	0
I need to switch from smart board brain to do board brain	0
Im almost having a hard time	0
In order for me to get	0
So you think to yourself the opposite so times you do divide plus you do minus so on and so forth	0
Increase 10 points	0
I want you working collaboratively with your team	0
Okay	0
Correct	0
B point B is four comma one	0
And we can do it with a colon or the word to or even with a for every statement	0
Because if I do 36 divided by nine that only equals 36	0
You got it	0
Turn and talk to the person next to you	0
Notice that they started with the base as the first number	0
But oneninth and oneninth and oneninth and oneninth thats what I have	0
One is for the circle quiz from yesterday one is from the PAMP level 4 test that I just gave you back	0
In this one	0
All right	0
Come on over and share	0
All right everybody	0
A point is where something starts or stops begins or ends	0
Im seeing most people say no	0
That is an easier way to do it	0
Yes	0
Thats the same thing for this	0
You can go help your team real quick and then you can come back and finish the problem	0
Well Mr	0
Now what I suggest you do	0
Number five one person from each group stand up and tell me what your answer is	0
I thought it would be 4	0
What is that	0
Can you kind of show me a picture of that here and  I want James I want to see if you understand what he s  saying	0
Four three two one	0
Julia this was not opened by you	0
Yeah	0
Hmmmm	0
Great	0
One two three four five six those up to six pieces	0
And also we dont know what the question is asking	0
No	0
And then I would do domain and range	0
Your learning objective is to multiply	0
But what do they have one of its that vocabulary word that I just erased on the board	0
Yes	0
Use n for figure and S for number of squares	0
Im going to see what time it is weve had a little bit of looseygoosey time	0
Split your board in half down the middle	0
And then if you didnt I want you to be able to tell me where you made the mistake	0
Excellent	0
Okay and then one other way you could name this one because its just an angle by itself you could just say angle y	0
Thats what had to go with the grid	0
Okay	0
The kid did that and had like some	0
Okay	0
All right we are going to move on to math and the first  No I dont want mail	0
Ms Julia Im going to ask you to explain the strategy you used to solve this math problem message	0
Three two one zero	0
When we have this its true one would want to say Ive got multiples of X on both sides	0
Think a little more	0
Thats why I put those two numbers over there	0
So my goal on the bottom is to get this number of yerts to 19	0
Well we dont have 21 in our sample	0
All right	0
Awesome	0
Here is the problem with that	0
He may change the radius to the diameter he may use it but he can also use the other formula	0
Two three four of you and disagree with three of you	0
I dont just need the answer	0
Six	0
Go ahead	0
Okay so I believe our kindergarten buddies are going to be here momentarily	0
Well like to here we would say it was thirty five	0
Franc Im going to have you come work with Clay	0
All right	0
Because 7100 is small than	0
That seems reasonable	0
We just talked	0
We want to make this one an improper fraction	0
Two equals minus two	0
And be ready to share some strategies	0
It was multistep	0
I am thinking	0
Do something	0
Good	0
But if you look at the pieces if you have eight students sharing those seven pizzas you color in eight of them its going to be really close to the whole thing	0
Yeah but since I said go	0
All the angles are in the same spot	0
If you think you can help me use my zero role to solve this problem	0
We have six plus two	0
Not so bad	0
I am going to look at the multiplication	0
The seven times eight is 56 might have kind of some limited applications	0
Listen to me read this again	0
Both look like  this is your only answer	0
My friend	0
She did it as a picture she drew a picture of it	0
Therefore the what were looking for as a solution its the points that meet each other	0
A story up about it	0
Right	0
Dont cut those off those are important	0
been really patient with people that dont know the answer and then we walk through it and thats okay	0
Its in the middle	0
The origin is where they meet and the origin is zero	0
Yes thats true but look at our denominators	0
Thank you	0
Horizontal axis	0
12 x 19 x 616	0
Whos got a pencil that small	0
We have another household size here	0
I know	0
You might want to write something out on a paper to do this	0
You all may not agree	0
Sorry	0
Oh	0
Abel are you still with us	0
Two and 35	0
Stella clip up Kelly clip up Margo Alexander clip up	0
Okay	0
This	0
Okay so now I have to come up with a number multiplied by 15	0
I want you to set up your ratio table	0
Okay but Hold on	0
Okay why don t you guys go ahead and clean up and we ll get ready for a recess break	0
Alexander	0
David and Brian have a couple comments	0
Because thats where I was trying to get	0
Okay	0
The next thing that Im just going to mark is called an ordered pair and then just Was going to call it D Next were going to do a four and a three and this is just an ordered pair	0
because if I asked you the factors	0
We will start with problem 23	0
They also show each one of their steps as well	0
Any other musicians	0
thats all right	0
Okay could you guys open up your Math books to five sixtythree	0
One other thing before we move on	0
You said  This means that the book will be 16 15 inches with width and height	0
I found that same thing with 30 and eight	0
You cant solve it	0
And you have four minutes go	0
Six13ths then six10ths then sixninths	0
A lot things for slope	0
Let s go here Ariel	0
We know that its	0
You dont seem to be making such a mess so Im not as concerned with yours	0
You type in Google Classroom	0
Yes sir	0
I took your pie away youre like I dont want to share it with that many people	0
Were going to be converting money like we did in our problem today but also time	0
I appreciate it	0
You just split it into half and have like four and a half or something	0
Sometimes it just helps to to ask a friend	0
Twelve	0
Id like to see it before Tomas finishes it up and well look at it together	0
Correct	0
Please think about that	0
And thats it	0
Wait wait a second youre saying twentyfour white ones would  equal your train	0
three times two	0
Okay so with our equation right here thanks Frankie	0
Hey team	0
Did I ever press record	0
Place the remaining sheets on my desk	0
No	0
You have a cold	0
I did two times eight	0
The 12  8 he came up with four so we knew that there was a four year age difference	0
Okay Im gonna let her go	0
You could bring your  calculator Jeff	0
Incredibly smart my loves	0
Sorry Im trying to	0
I disagree on the basis that I chose	0
Okay	0
Multiply the denominator to the numerator	0
You have this here hurry up so you can finish it up	0
That would be really embarrassing because Id have to go put all the stuff back or I would have to figure out what I can keep and what I can remove	0
Lets go back to our four quadrant graphic where sometimes the four quadrants are recording in the middle of the day	0
Ok Im  ready to listen	0
Lucy you are absolutely right in your thinking	0
So here is what we are going to do	0
So thats all you have to add to the first one	0
The title of our notes today are ordering fractions	0
Thats okay I want you to do a new one today	0
Its not being respectful	0
Be specific about how you think the book will change	0
Then youre going to start with the next problem on page 51 of your note catcher	0
So I would like for you to take a look at this table and ask yourself does this make mathematical sense	0
Give them names	0
This is kind of based on when I did our club last year	0
So put a dot on negative five	0
It s a different  kind of proof than maybe one is accustomed to seeing	0
Before I even think about things I want thats the last thing I think about	0
So Im going to start with Cassidys	0
Ok so this is how much ribbon you have	0
Right	0
Now the really nice thing about making a table like this is is you get a very clear if you did your slope right your pattern works the whole time	0
The result is accurate the easier to use	0
Okay	0
Ill show you	0
Then you can lower your hands	0
Good	0
Howd you come up with that and I told him and he doubted me doubting Thomas because he knows everything	0
Quickly	0
So you would put four like this and you would give the red  the number name one fourth	0
All right you guys	0
As were getting going in second semester quick reminder	0
That was great	0
I know that all of the peaks and the valleys are going to match up	0
Lets look lets look	0
Okay	0
Picky pants over there	0
Zero minus four is negative four	0
Cole tell me what you think	0
69 hundreds	0
Mike get handled  that book please thank you	0
Some of them are already in the expanded form	0
You still have my calculator	0
Its a review	0
Lets think about the number 20	0
But I dont understand because I went into that and its not giving me the pages Im looking for	0
Im going to let you go five minutes early for today	0
All right now lets look at this one because this one is telling you to double the first from the original number but leave the second one alone	0
So  down here were going to do 90 times 50	0
Catch Lukina	0
When you added it up he wanted 12 of a chocolate bar	0
Bless you	0
You can do it next time	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
Thank you for telling me	0
Yes you may work with a partner	0
Right	0
And heres three wholes	0
So kind of between middle kind of 75	0
it is every day	0
Well this is  I have to put this together  this was the whole  candy bar	0
3 times 1026	0
Then you can sharpen it	0
Hm	0
Okay	0
That would have worked too	0
Hopefully	0
Well just ignore it	0
Okay so itd be bisecting an angle	0
It also make it look like this	0
Okay how about this one you walked over	0
I have two little girls at home and they whine all the time and that doesnt work either	0
Margo is saying Im trying to get to 100 this is our goal because we want to get to percent chance and you guys I just really hope youre going to be ready for the final in a week	0
so you can see my beautiness	0
Okay	0
Now the first ones a little tricky because 56 is a hard one because theres probably more than you think of	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
Thanks Sarah	0
Okay	0
Which one is bigger and how do you know	0
For a hundred steps three hundred and forty so it will be three twenty	0
No youve got room in the corner there to write it	0
It is super important today that you draw all four pictures	0
Lets get Silas to power clap	0
And our answer would be 109 and 38	0
Absolutely nothing so 10 cannot be a common denominator	0
No worries	0
So youll see these a lot	0
That is our learning intention for today	0
Yeah so we didnt think about it this way too	0
but its not your job right now	0
You should be on the carpet with your dry erase board your two papers and Im looking where I thought I had some extra papers sit down	0
And then uh part D	0
you would break it down and right	0
Thank you for taking a risk	0
Okay	0
So 3x plus three y plus nine equals 180	0
Norman tell me about the factors	0
And then were gonna kind of do these two together	0
Ive got fun data for you today	0
Yes I can make it	0
So were going to write that first	0
So Im not going to give you the answer to this	0
The pouches have seals	0
Yeah you could	0
Im a very intelligent woman	0
Thanks	0
So these are very similar	0
Whats up Lizzie	0
Guys Im going to keep putting this on the board until you guys understand that you need to know that	0
Two	0
Were not estimating	0
You should get out something that would be a good toolkit idea good toolkit notes because you can use toolkits on the quiz on Thursday	0
So everybody write 1 by 1	0
Its okay if youre marking your map	0
Put your whiteboards and markers away	0
It says Just carefully look at your symbols and carefully look at the order	0
Were only going to compare it to tuna	0
It starts at the bottom of the book	0
Some people are getting a bit more specific than that	0
Repeated subtraction	0
Now onehalf is pretty easy because theres another way you can do it	0
Yes I did it differently this time	0
Some of you do not  think we need to make the number line longer	0
Is there anybody who doesnt have cards	0
Okay	0
This is what your answer should look like	0
Multiply 6   30	0
121	0
So this is how we use our multiplication chart for multiplication we think okay four times eight I need to find the four	0
Sit up	0
Oh it might not even	0
So our sentence says The ratio of tablespoons of oil to cups of tomato sauce is 5 to 2	0
Ownership	0
Okay	0
Nice	0
I like that idea	0
Ok Im wondering if you can share that with Jessica who  didnt hear what you just said because I I might ask you  later why does that work	0
Lets think about from yesterday what isnt what is another denominator that you could make an equivalent fraction for	0
Right	0
Okay	0
Okay so I should see nearly everybody right now on this slide drawing in some slope triangles	0
This is m divided by A Im trying to get the M alone because it says solve for m So I think in my brain whats the opposite of divide by a the opposite is times a	0
So before we talk about anything on this page lets kind of think about of about a month ago we talked about how to how to prove that triangles are congruent	0
Did he say the ice cream shop	0
Okay	0
If you doIf you add subtract multiply and divide	0
So you got two minutes see what you can do and then call on some people to see what they come up with for these	0
Okay	0
I have to be sure because Dr Goldin needs to  hear it a few times	0
Two	0
So now we move down to our second row	0
Okay	0
All right	0
Its only that blue point	0
Okay thats a variable	0
Is it going to be 250	0
Ill also give you some some heads up about whats What next week is going to look like just you can kind of start preparing for that	0
10	0
And friends when I go back if you are not participating when I look at this it gives me um the names of the people that participated and the names that it did not	0
okay get your whiteboards and I want you to show me how you know how to do this	0
Okay	0
So then this one right here is Im looking at Brendas	0
3 6 9 12	0
Okay	0
Im just not really sure how to do it	0
Okay	0
Diagonal	0
You gave us a good starting point Piper	0
Then Georgia just worked with your table group	0
Okay	0
On page one you are to do two from each row	0
Pencil down pencil down pencil down pencil down	0
Is that what I would put	0
We want a fifth plus a 10th	0
Let s see very well	0
Theyre both fairly easy if you pay attention but Ill tell you that both of these things are impossible if you dont pay attention because youre going to be misled by the data	0
Yeah	0
Can I tell the answer to the whole	0
Strathom	0
I think thats perfectly reasonable depends what your definition of being a good surfer is like is it the best times or is it the most consistent just depends	0
So um if each person so in each of our pieces Haley has eight pieces	0
No	0
You were just talking about working backwards to figure out where its going to connect that line	0
It says find the area	0
Close	0
So Im going to write 24 over 12	0
Theres that one	0
What the heck	0
Turn your cameras on so I can watch you work please	0
Theres going to be a parenthesis there	0
Okay	0
So let me ask you a question	0
Theres one  theres two theres three theres four	0
Youre going to do your number four	0
Every week it goes down 5	0
Now we think about how we can write a fraction equation	0
Id rather have 34 of a hundred things than 248 of a thousand things	0
Wow	0
And then for the emperor penguins we said it was smaller because it has the same amount  at 52	0
Now looking at this Im kinda like Okay this is a little bit of a difficult system of equations because V is on the other side of the equal sign	0
But I wanted to give you some more kind of slightly more challenging questions and the ones that weve been doing the past couple days	0
So I multiplied my numerator and my denominator by 25 to say 35 is equivalent to 75 hundredths which is equal to 75	0
Okay two more	0
So they added something and didnt give us new Ts editions is what they did	0
You know zero times everything is zero right	0
This is attached	0
Then Im going to have you	0
Jacquelyn This is one whole and this is two	0
So we have 412ths plus 312ths	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
Right	0
Get each combination write in fraction or addition	0
TRUE	0
Press the On button bottom lefthand corner	0
Okay	0
Oh	0
It would be four	0
So I have 20 40 8	0
This one is going to be good for a quick discussion	0
So you have to physically put the tick marks in	0
Thats right yes well	0
Okay hold on	0
Silva was going to New York	0
Okay	0
Why does it stay on you	0
You also have this in front of you	0
No	0
Before we do some more independent practice	0
Mr Colin thats not going to work for me	0
Okay	0
And I say okay if they each get one little one	0
Yeah	0
No	0
We are	0
okay	0
Owen	0
And five and 10	0
Your point will be right here where those two lines intercept	0
So going back Terrance was a four to five ratio	0
Okay	0
We evaluated that example	0
Actually it pretty much looks like that	0
That two is going to cancel that two the negatives are going to cancel each other	0
If this were nine here then you would think of this as 10 minus nine	0
It s like	0
And I owe Eagle bucks	0
It doesnt have	0
Being ready to explain how you know	0
It means both sides are identically the same	0
So this is Jackson I need your expertise	0
A different way to think about fractions and whole numbers	0
But now Im making ribbons that are  three meters long	0
You cant third it using one rod but you can third  it using trains	0
Instead of saying it as it takes two cups to equal one pint were almost working in reverse	0
My point is when we deconstructed these fractions we did it in two entirely different ways and yet we came up with the same amount	0
Okay	0
Oops there we go	0
Lets take a look at Harpers	0
should be 4	0
Fifths	0
Okay	0
Yep 94	0
Thanks girls	0
Okay thank you	0
All the calculations	0
I didnt think that sounded right	0
Okay	0
Ill need Ill need a few	0
Now I know its hard to see down at the bottom	0
Everything is perfectly added	0
Our goal is to get our math vocabulary better	0
And remember similarity means same angles same exact shape just different sizes	0
B2	0
Exactly	0
Okay	0
So youre actually going to work in opposites	0
Thank you	0
Good	0
Good	0
Yes we cant	0
Youre going to write this at the top of page eight	0
It was three fourths should have been on the x coordinate and the two thirds should have been on the y coordinate	0
We go on vacation a lot too so we have to have people do our lawn	0
Of course now they are equations only	0
Thank you	0
Its weighted only 20 and its only 1 point out of all that yes	0
So you can mention another  number and Ill tell you	0
Yes	0
So well have to see if theres seven or eight or not	0
Yeah give us real hard ones	0
Number two	0
Now 50 of these were boys and 40 of these are boys	0
One divided by three	0
You didnt get one	0
We want to find the same number of plates and cups	0
It doesnt have to be perfect	0
All you really missed was a cool picture of The Rock earlier and you can Google pictures of The Rock later if you want to	0
Uh hang on also also 10	0
If I tell you to go and clean the windows with a squeegee can you do it	0
Oh yes I just Yes you can get that one	0
Those two guys combined to give me the 6 x	0
Okay so Maddy I didnt want you to solve it	0
and if were kind of comparing the drawings it goes yellow highlighter blue highlighter purple yellow blue purple over here and f is in between three ticks and one tick D is in between three ticks	0
A lot of this is reminders of what we talked about at the beginning of this book	0
You can do it a little bit darker because you shaded in lightly the first time so you can x it in 18	0
So for example for this one same deal Im gonna draw another right angle	0
Okay were done	0
Okay begin	0
But if I m doing volume if I m  stacking these right I m going to count how many of these  it s gotta turn into the cubic unit	0
Somebodys beeping	0
So what then I would do is I could do one of two things	0
Thank you	0
Eight plus three is 11	0
Because if I draw my line down I know that it takes 2 fourth pieces	0
Youre only thinking	0
Okay 85	0
Again	0
So yesterday our math message was let me go back to Im going to close that	0
Okay do you need a little marker so you can see	0
Thats amazing	0
Okay friends actually we dont need another one	0
Next we need to transition quietly and quickly	0
Slope is two y intercepts negative seven	0
This would be more like Mariah and Harvey	0
Oh you double you doubled every time	0
Then I have one two three responses of one awesome	0
And then figure four is what you just drew	0
We always agree	0
Okay	0
No	0
Go	0
Yes	0
paper that you did the other day that we said had all those steps I had two people that actually used the term I knew that 35 was more than 12 and 15 was less than 12 or something was closer to a whole	0
Yeah	0
You can just stay back	0
So if we count by twos count by twos with me	0
They have one quart of water	0
You are going to page 163 in your math journal	0
Lets see if I can make it a little smaller	0
Whenever we are marking on a coordinate grid we have something that are called	0
Heres the thing if you just start saying we use the five because its whats on the bottom	0
Good thinking	0
So you know like so on	0
Okay	0
So touchdown or or sit down sit down	0
Okay	0
Thats very cute	0
Your estimation is going to be a little less than one between a half and one between two and three	0
Okay so the slope is negative two	0
Then Ill end by doing Brendans house with three and Hectors house with three	0
inaudible partner your answers	0
The majority of you were using partial products	0
Can I ask a question	0
You can mix them up if you want	0
So were not looking at the perimeter were looking at how many dots are in each figure	0
Thank you for returning those	0
Good job crew	0
Now you have a multiple of X alone	0
So its but its not	0
Four and three	0
Email me if you want to retake the quiz and know that you have to send me those corrections	0
You got about 60 more seconds to finish your drawings while we talk and then we are moving on with todays lesson	0
Can you go diagonal in this	0
Right	0
multiply both	0
Jackson	0
And Im going to draw in a couple of lines here	0
You guys know all of that vocabulary	0
The important part was which ones going to help me understand what you know and what you dont know	0
Landons with Harper	0
Good	0
So lets look at problem B Linda sold nine bookmarks	0
Lets do triangles	0
Yeah make a legal substitution but make it true	0
Y 2X  19	0
Im going to pick up my broken flower	0
Right	0
Very good	0
Not the inside	0
So once we have the factors we are trying to find a common factor	0
I got my answer	0
If you need to expand it simplify it please do it in your classwork book	0
Okay	0
Thats	0
Okay	0
Thats the same thing 5 regardless	0
I want to take five and turn it into 10	0
Um zero	0
Were going to talk about how people can take advantage of you	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Okay here we go	0
So my suggestion is start like they did	0
Still check	0
Not really	0
Before we talk as a whole group Im going to have you meet with your two by two partner	0
Because in the rules it says you cant have more than one in the numerator	0
Oh yes	0
Oh youre back I guess Ill change your absence to a presence	0

Because Yeah I could count by Oh yeah Im sorry	0
When we when we after you answer these questions if you get that far please make sure you do this quickwrite	0
I agree with Bryan because if no one ever saw a  number line they would think that this was one third  and this was two thirds	0
I m confused what you re doing	0

Now my straight edge is right there and I would have to delete my sailboat from where I have it right now	0
I thought the easiest way to do it was	0
Now when you find your slope and I see a few people have already done this which looks great	0
Awesome	0
Because you just told me you did 11x28 thats not estimating thats actually doing the problem	0
No	0
If you dont understand the concept I need to know	0
You are going to round to the nearest hundredth	0
A B	0
Now later on when I teach you something called coordinate gridding youre going to learn that theres two axes that we work on	0
Not so bad right	0
You said 5 divided by 3	0
Show your work using a ratio table	0
Hey guys	0
Well you cant see through the board but you can through the overhead sheets	0
This is the number one thing that we do	0
The five wants to be a  normal size five	0
You are both going to make sure that your name is on your paper	0
And then you have your plus four thats where it started or where it crosses the y axis	0
Thats kind of like the example we just did and the very last activity we did	0
Okay make F of two is positive four that means the point two comma four would be on your graph	0
And then I see some shapes that have an area of three	0
Remember think about the guy	0
These arent perpendicular cause They dont cross	0
She did her trading first and then she did her subtraction	0
Isosceles triangle and this is 80	0
Thats what your percentile prediction would be	0

But thats what Im doing Im doing the blues stuck  together	0
I guess were	0
If you have started work with your partner and make sure that your points are correct	0
If we were to put dots in here My dots are not evenly spaced	0
Well that two was the x	0
So y equals my slope	0
Im coming over to the whiteboard and I am going to represent the no side	0
Six and then 42	0
Youre right	0
So 3 is positive	0
You can add 79 plus	0
Because it was a multiplying by like a 10th	0
Yes	0
Cool	0
One two three four five	0
The student yeah did actually find 6 I just cut that off because I didnt want you to to see that too quickly	0
So imagine youre making these designs	0
Now this is the microphone here	0
Just be careful for little tricks like that with data	0
Were looking pretty good on this	0
Hold on Rita	0
Maybe they didnt get 48 or a half at the beginning but then you revised your thinking after working with your partner	0
And so the x intercept would be 14 zero	0
Its literally just an	0
So 100x1 is 100	0
A couple of them were closShane earlier so hopefully I remember which ones those were	0
So write A times A times A	0

Being able to explain the complexities of why something is what it is is never easy	0
You are rounding it to the nearest tenths not a whole tenth	0
Think about daily lives of your parents what they have to pay for what they have to budget for and what they have to subtract and add constantly	0
Mmhm	0
Grant sit up	0
I mean Ill ask this question and Ill have people share out	0

Down three over four	0
You have a little check in quiz tomorrow and Im specifically going to try and trick you with this	0
Remember you used this back at the beginning of the year  when we were remote  virtual	0
I had it open and I accidentally closed it so sorry	0
Excellent	0
Hundredths	0
and then and then we kind of clarify because someone said Oh the nine hundreds is going to be closer to zero	0
All right my lovely ladies	0
Two	0
You think about how you might write your equation	0
Ive  heard some people tell me this already	0
X can end up being negative even if all the other numbers are positive	0
You dont need to add that to yours but Ill just add it so you know what I did	0
If its two squared then its four so try to the third power which is eight and so on	0
Right there	0
Um this goes up to 40	0
Everybody stand up and keep your chair out	0
But put the you put 12 in for N and then you do the multiplication and then you add	0
And if thats the case that means the middle of each line should be the same point	0
Lets take our next one	0
If you have a partner go find some place to work	0
So our first problem here says paid 47 for three tickets to a concert	0
Erase your boards	0
One two three four five six and you needed five of the six	0
Okay	0
That youre going to call one	0
You said youd like to try addition	0
Every two seconds she goes three meters two seconds three meters	0
Yes	0
You could use the board too	0
54 55  53 54 55 56 57 59 60 61 62	0
Were almost done with this phase of	0
All right	0
Who was passing out 152	0
Theres no difference first of all than what you were just doing	0
This one	0
Thank you	0
Okay so we are all going to get into our online math McGraw Hill	0
Thank you so much	0
But were going to review a little bit of that today and tomorrow	0
Okay three	0
Like that but no if you that could change the two	0
I walked out the door and it lost me	0
And that would be sixthirds	0
Okay	0
Yeah you can make three bows	0
Theyre all in their place value	0
please take one hexagon one trapezoid and one rhombus and put them on your desk	0
Look at the pattern	0
Quit talking about how much fun it is and do it	0
And were going to start here	0
Just 12 and then you can play fraction up	0
Mack you forgot to borrow	0
Now lets just take a flight of imagination and keep this one  here in your mind lets move this one heres a second one	0
Okay friends	0
Okay	0
But I dont know about you guys but I never eat a pizza without cutting it into pieces	0
Bug is 3X 3Y	0
Six things for the six pages	0
It just has to be correct	0
But its the same as you told me last time  is 2000	0
Okay	0
So it is equal to positive 16	0
Angle K is 90 degrees	0
and I turned back by the same amount	0
Im going to put mine below	0
There you go	0
Okay	0
Ninety	0
All right	0

From point B	0
I did that	0
One second	0
Okay so Mason what Haven is doing is she is just rounding	0
I know	0
Thank you so much	0
Were going to start out on the floor but you need your papers first	0
Okay	0
Okay so this does not work because slope is undefined	0
If you think about it that way people want to be like okay well lets divide it in half first and then well solve it from there	0
Now this example is on page oneosix people so you have your choice here	0
Well analyze that a little bit deeper coming up	0
Who did do you have to put the parenthesis around the minus six or would that be considered a negative six	0
I want to see all your steps here	0
One of you will be a group of three and one of you will be a group of two	0
Okay	0
Alright I hope we have all this written down because Im gonna go ahead and erase this	0
So were still using the same recipes but were making different batches	0
Lets work together to fill in some of this thinking	0
Talk for one minute and then Im gonna bring you back	0
And I ve come to learn that not all rulers are alike	0
You have 45 more seconds	0
Yes	0
So then Ive given them all of this Ive taken it away so Im going to take it off my table	0
Yes	0
This is about beating our current juniors	0
Now lets see if you can find anything here	0
make sure that youre using a comparison	0
Okay	0
Guys up here eyes	0
Six thirtieths	0
Y1 plus Y2 over two	0
All right	0
But let me show you this is kind of what River was saying before	0
Please complete that	0
Yeah	0
Or if you want to write it like this you could say y equals thats really the same thing because M is the y axis and n is the x axis however you want to write it its fine	0
Not very many people used that strategy	0
And now you do	0
Four five and six on your own	0
then she gave Cindy one and then she ate another 3	0
Remember it does not matter yet how you write them just put all four numbers up there	0
So for these problems name the angle relationship find the value of the variables then find the measure of each labeled angle	0
I thought you said Rexford	0
multiples of three would be three times one is three three times two is six three times two three is nine	0
Now if I add a three to it Ive got to multiply my three by the ones place value the tens place value and hundreds place value	0
That could be dividing	0
The only other thing I added this time was batches	0
And then what so I have 70 of these in a pile	0
So you re going to take another role take the role of taking an argument that makes  sense if you can or showing that some argument doesn t make sense	0
Yay	0
So our answer is eight	0
I think its these piles	0
Then 1000	0
Grab a pencil	0
Square root of 36 is six	0
All right while you finish off writing this everybody else for every mix number there is an improper fraction and for every improper fraction there is a mix number	0
You wrote down 10 times 10 six times	0
Yeah	0
Thats 360 minus X	0
21 and seven is 28	0
Were trying to find this corner and this corner	0
Let me erase these terms real quick so that we can work out with the problem	0
Very good	0
Yes	0
Adam sit down	0
For finals were basically doing everything weve worked on	0
Eight volume problems	0
Oh this everybody better know	0
Do it first in your notebook	0
Eight cubed fine	0
Rosta you will go with them good	0
I would say that this page if you spend your time really trying to understand one thing from this unit I would pick this page	0
Franc and Kayla	0
Okay	0
So this angle right here is 85 degrees	0
So theres kind of three ways you can think about this problem down nine over six down three over two down three over two down three over two	0
Okay so let me draw what you just said	0
so we	0
You didnt turn them into an improper fraction	0
Show one full rotation clockwise	0
I did not	0
Take the S as the subject	0
I need to see work on paper Im going to model for you my expectation because a lot of you are like Is this right	0
You can just write it this way	0
Okay	0
Lets walk	0
How many marbles can fit in the bag	0
Because it said break apart one to four fourths	0
So what this shows us is that you have a drop the rise is negative 10 or drops by 10	0
You guys are like stop Strathom just stop	0
I started off this semester showing you your GPA as a class compared to previous classes and how it was a little bit lower	0
Right	0
Three	0
And that was 108	0
Mmhmm	0
Okay	0
Oh my gosh	0
Heres your doughnut	0
So Im um we have found that 38ths plus five eighths equals eight eighths or one whole that means he has one tube of paint	0
But theyre using base 10	0
Because that is our learning objective	0
Cant do it	0
Look looks like its a constant rate of change of plus three	0
Yeah it does	0
Less than 22	0
One two	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
Sure	0
Ooh aquatic animals	0
Yeah I dont like that	0
Yeah	0
Jackie thought of the two	0
Yes its your job to help them get ready	0
So zeros for everything else	0
That s okay	0
The run is six	0
Okay	0
Talk about just that information and how do you know	0
Its not	0
Ive got to have a whole number and I need a 12 to make it more effective	0
Okay in you go	0
I know that the larger the dividend the more there is to divide up so the larger the quotient	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
I dont know if they put that on there because it had white stuff on it	0
Okay now	0
Ok lets give you some more	0
Think about terms that we use	0
Were going to be practicing and so youre going to have a chance to go back to your seat in just a second and what I want you to do is turn your dry erase board over so I know youre listening to Mrs Cooper for a minute	0
We do that when people say	0
Okay	0
This pen is going to be a huge issue	0
Because if you do not use a straight edge this is not going to come out correctly	0
You guys are better at math than mental math	0
Awesome	0
This is called investigating Egyptian fractions	0
Okay	0
This red line	0
Alright so heres what were gonna do	0
Or Amy and Zoe	0
Okay so the vertical line test if I move this line across though its only crossing at one spot that whole spot	0
Oh my gosh	0
your order there	0
All right lets do one more	0
I know what youre trying to say but lets work on how youre saying it	0
That	0
So thats an equation showing you put those fractions in order from the biggest all the way to the smallest	0
It goes up two vertically and then horizontally	0
Okay my next group I want Miriam Mia Bo and Jackson	0
And then here I have since minus three T youve got to have a T here in any case and over there as well	0
And then part B as a class took 34 of what was left	0
Think about your answers guys	0
You did	0
Two	0
If not I will ask some of you to come up and try some of the questions	0
No bacause that would be in the negative	0
So three X plus two then times two equals 19	0
Yes indeed that square	0
Now these two different types of fractions have special names	0
And the person doing multiples needs to find the first six multiples of the number eight	0
So write two	0
Ill give you a few minutes to do that	0
This says We use the words same rate to describe two situations that have equivalent ratios	0
No I dont want you to answer it	0
Start thinking about it	0
Mhm	0
This is my whole pizza	0
When you are done okay so	0
Im doing my absolute best	0
All right	0
Did you win some games this weekend	0
Okay so were good to go	0
This is what we did	0
Thats right	0
All right	0
Try three and six	0
So if I took this little piece here	0
It says construct rays	0
No think about it	0
Thats not a realworld situation	0
I dont know which ones they are	0
Some of you might look at this and think Okay I can do this adding	0
Okay their pizzas are cut into eight slices	0
Active learner girl	0
Exactly what we just did except Im telling you what youre going to use to find your equivalent fraction	0
So Im going to draw my three cards	0
Okay	0
And put it on the board and each of you have a chance to place it and then it would be easier for you to check it out and measure it	0
So we could do 30 to make 13 into a fraction which is the 13 over one	0
We want it to say there are five less in the bag okay	0
Okay	0
Wow	0
Okay	0
space it out a little bit	0
It can be candy to use doubling and multiplying by 10 but the process works with any number	0
Ok	0
I dont bother about the Xs for the time being	0
Is it hard to be like Pink thats a pink	0
About 30 wide	0
Im going to ask a question	0
You might	0
You might remember from yesterday when we had our objective we talked about when I divide am I finding the size of the groups or the number of groups	0
Yes	0
So the answer is 40	0
Mr Blacksmith forged Ritirovs horses	0
Read it very carefully so you dont make a mistake	0
Those are similar	0
Now guys the math message is just at the top	0
Zero	0
Um because I can spell right because each domain value only has one arrow	0
So this is a kind of writing it out in words with tenthst	0
So lets go back to this	0
Good	0
So in geometry in triangles if you have a side thats the same as the sides another triangle if you have an angle thats the same as the other one you have another side thats equal to the other one and the angle is in between those sides it has to be included between those sides then those triangles are congruent	0
This equation is very different from just y equals two y equals two A flatline at y equals twoy equals 2x means its going up by two every time going through the origin	0
ATT is the first one	0
Yes	0
Yes	0
90 and 200	0
Wow were moving along just fine	0
Money now	0
Lets come back and look at it	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Im going to ask you to do everything on page two of your packet	0
Yes	0
Thats where it becomes tenths hundredths thousandths	0
Full wedges	0
Great	0
1 2 3 show me your boards	0
All right excellent job	0
So our objectives for today are this	0
Yes we did yellow	0
And were going to add them up	0
microphone	0
Is it on the very first page	0
You have to line up your decimals	0
55	0
But what we would say is this	0
I now have three and twosixths minus one and threesixths	0
Oh no go to My Documents	0
I know	0
Uhm	0
Yes that will help you	0
It does not look like that one so go back through	0
Try it on your dry erase boards	0
So I just wanted to make sure that you guys understood the difference between models and tools	0
I dont know	0
I do not know why that weird line shows up sometimes but were going to just deal with it	0
Good	0
When you start studying Algebra youll need to know this formula	0
wait	0
So that didnt work	0
Ill draw the arrow way up here	0
This divide	0
So you did this one times two times three	0
Thats the biggest vocabulary term I guess I should say term for today	0
One	0
There you go	0
Use the grid to help you draw if needed	0
Nice work give David a power clap one two three	0
Excellent	0
The amount of money well in the beginning	0
Which would be 312 and then 312 plus 412 is 712	0
If I give you an X of something and say go find an X of negative four youd be like oh cool I found it	0
When you are done I want you complete your math lectures	0
either way its fine	0
Thats what Im  wondering	0
Yes	0

It sounds very similar to its synonym	0
In going to write in some stuff to get people started if you need this	0
I thought you would think well its two fourths is a half	0
Number one is yes it is correct	0
On your white boards	0
Oh well lets see here	0
And then you say how much should we have leftover	0
Okay so Michael step back for just a second	0
Ha ha aw go on	0
Please stop	0
And we can tell that easier if we can see them	0
So I was	0
Youre holding us all up	0
Ive already got the three in the plus symbol	0
Okay so for everybody lets lets talk about the y intercept first	0
A half a cup a quarter cup	0
What Erik said is that two whites equal one red so it would be the  exact same thing	0
Were going to count by five	0
The shaded part	0
All right my friends	0
Three	0
Y coordinate is second	0
I would like you to use a different color if possible	0
Thats what were doing today youre going to model each of the atoms	0
Every step on your whiteboard every single step on your whiteboard	0
Is that I Owen	0
Because theyre so good at hiding	0
Five times three is 15 three times three is nine and eight times three is 24	0
To make sure we all know what hes up to what hes thinking about	0
So now one two three four	0
You figured out the tumblers are going to cost 528	0
Thats okay Hunter	0
Okay	0
That is correct	0
Yes	0
And um when we write it would it be draw up a five point six centimeter	0
Lets give Victoria a power clap	0
Hey crew	0
Okay and then Im going to steal some peoples words here	0
Im going to give you guys two minutes to do some really thoughtful responses	0
Okay nice	0
The table below	0
They just want the expressions	0
So one comma four two comma eight three comma 12 four comma 16 five comma 20	0
Well thats probably good that you didnt eat them last week then	0
I told him  because Marks in 3rd grade but Mayas in here	0
Yes only do this first step right here	0
Our question is this line you ll learn when you get to high school geometry but you will learn this when you get to high school geometry but I know that you will learn this before you get to high school geometry we can think of as made up of lots of points	0
Byebye journal	0
Are you supposed to check all of these or are you supposed to make these to that	0
So you look at it if you have the same answer	0
So I highlighted two different sets	0
No quotient is divisions product is that	0
Maybe their in the drawing draw it	0
Example 2 working backwards	0
We are going to talk a lot about this common denominator strategy today	0
Is that minu is that minus or	0
Its like a tent that I drew	0
So algorithm is a set of step by step instructions for doing something such as carrying out a computation or solving a problem	0
If you use the rods to sort of bracket like this	0
I I thought I followed you but Im  not so sure that Brian and Michael followed  what you said	0
Okay	0
It can be anywhere in the room	0
Then for 23 they shaded in red	0
Draw an area model	0
Or youre gonna have this other possible solution over here which means x plus seven equals zero	0
You can work on those proofs if you want or you can work on PAMP 51	0
Wow I hope youre going to  thats very	0
This one your equation would be length x width but look at number two	0
I have my hand on my head	0
Okay Im pretty good	0
Were going to distribute the three to the four	0
a third of 14	0
And since its negative one half that means you would go down by one for the rise because the rise is up and down	0
Very good	0
I found a dark one	0
Okay thats good Calvin for right now	0
These cards could work in all different ways but to figure out Okay	0
Just waiting on Veronica	0
Okay so first label thats your first job	0
Dont come to me for the answer	0
Alison do you want	0
Thank you	0
Where did you like why did you put the one next to the two at the top	0
And right	0
Well there its to leave it like that	0
Hello	0
Okay the last one we have is 50	0
She did 180 minus 170 got 110 for this angle here	0
So exit outta that	0
All right	0
Harmonys dad wants her to calculate the tax for the items they are buying	0
So it cant be any different	0
Can you pull up your	0
So this uh square root of a sorry uh negative sorry square root of negative four	0
Im coming Im coming	0
All right so here lets divide by 2 ok divided by two divided by 2 x equals 38	0
Oh is it this one	0
They left you	0
Sit up	0
Its a square pizza	0
Move to side honey so we can see	0
if you connect them like this	0
3 matches 213 matches to those are all different three matches two three and then three matches to four those are all different but theyre all for the same x value	0
Jaki tell us one double digit number she should use using all of her single digits	0
So I still have another half a tube of paint and a half plus a half is a hole	0
No no	0
You should not have two	0
I still have that	0
Alright	0
Youre going to circle	0
Were going to set up a couple more ratio tables	0
Now Alan is going to share with us his piece of the  number line between zero and one	0
So we combine two factors to get the product	0
Good	0
Because 6060 is 120 plus 30 is 150 six goes into 60 10 times so theres 10 groups of six	0
These are just draggables	0
Stack them up so you have one on your left and two on your right	0
That is an example of a fraction number line we can follow for today	0
So should be less than because if you take half of 34 its going to be less than that	0
How do we know	0
Please start now	0
How long should it take you to take out fraction circle pieces	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Come on Wyatt	0
Five and two thirds	0
Theres two types of	0
Let me see where youre at	0
Seven	0
Okay so you need to erase that and then these two need to be connected with a straight line and then these connected to here	0
Same one that was on the homework	0
You put it underneath it	0
This is a five by seven	0
So that I absolutely agree with you	0
So were going to subtract seven subtract seven	0
And Ill give you a hint	0
This eight and this 12 they share a common factor of a four	0
Ok	0
We did one times two equals two two times two equals two but look at our cups over here	0
And number four do not forget to complete those	0
Its just kind of a collection of random point shoes	0
And 230 X minus 200 X is less than or equal to 2100 minus 2000	0
In a different color thank you Clay in a different color	0
How would you thank you	0
So three fourths and two fourths would be around four and a half	0
Its okay to make a mistake	0
They all have to be the same pieces	0
But we we call the whole one	0
Your sentence starter if youre number two or number four is  My thinking is  because whether youre right or wrong its okay	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
So now just like Sarah said well the greatest account balance Im looking for a high and the least account balance now Im looking for down low	0
Okay	0
Then you get X is equal to 112	0
Number 1 is were going to talk about this warmup	0
Yes	0
And you have the last 10 minutes of class to get startedon that	0
Ok	0
Good to hear	0
Eight	0
Its all right	0
Making sure that these are lined up is very important	0
Always understand	0
So thats the midpoint for that one	0
To show that yellow is a separate category from red and red is a separate category from green	0
Actually I should write it on a poster so you guys can have it for	0
And then well go from there	0
When you multiply three times nine youll get the proper number I guess	0
Okay	0
Milin can you keep your hands straight in the air or do you have to go like this	0
Okie dokie artichokey	0
Yes fine	0
So you dont round up	0
No	0

5   10  50	0
Dont change it	0
So I want you playing against the computer	0
Youre thinking whether its wrong or youre thinking its right	0
Good Prince	0
And then I want you to solve it	0
New story	0
Were creating some really great ratio tables  under question number two in our packets	0
All right thanks everybody	0
Lets see what you think	0
Oh well	0
This is positive	0
And heres the good news	0
And they have to order a small grande	0
I know depends on which side youre on I guess	0
Hmm hmm	0
And you get all these other points all the way through your graph that fit all three of those	0
No because if you multiply this by two you would get two sixths	0
Lets see	0

We re not going to make you plug it in to prove that it doesn t  You just check it visually but you have to check it	0
First before you turn and talk tell your shoulder partner kneetoknee	0
I have 74 thats 1 and thats way down here	0
I thought I had already opened that	0
I picked you because I saw that you did write hers done correctly	0
It should be on the ninth millimeter	0
So use this this one talks about slope rise over run	0
So for example and I know this is a little bit more tricky for you to do on your computer	0
So there are 20 pieces of data	0
For the sake of time because the partially filled tray is a lot of letters	0
If you are a sixth grader or a young seventh grader compared to other people in the grade theres two options	0
Okay	0
But its not	0
Excellent	0

So it would have gotten two one two three four and then	0
Can you see SS that	0
The picture above shows how much casserole the class took	0
Awesome keep going	0
I add five I add five	0
They are problems that we dont know if we can solve or not until we try	0

Thousand 785	0
Yes	0
and our letters for this one and write them off to the side again side angle side s a s Right	0
And then you and your partner compare where you put 28 hundredths on your number line while I get my next screen up	0
Check you have other people	0
And then plus if that one the answer here this one goes out here and then this one goes out here	0
So Im going to write this one	0
We have math class the day after tomorrow right	0
We are proving that we wanted to make  sure that when you divide it into thirds there s no left over  or anything so we can actually	0
All right	0
Yeah	0
That means each hat costs 5	0
The numbers were right	0
So to get started we can read our explanations	0
And you can use 10 because it takes you to 270	0
Six hundred eighty onethousandths and I want you to round it to the nearest hundredth	0
Excellent	0
divisor and the divisor tells me how many equal groups I am going to make	0
Todd	0
All right	0
Thats delicious to them	0
2x equals 76	0
Okay	0
So it makes 3  3  3 which equals 9	0
No its not	0
Okay	0
This gives us our directions for how to get to 207	0

Plus eh	0
Can I help Ethan	0
If I said How many miles did we drive all together then wed add her miles and my miles and thats how many miles we drove all together but with fractions I went part of the way and she went part of the way	0
Im not sure	0
Were searching for important information	0
You got 4	0
It was purple in case youre having trouble finding it	0
I did it wrong but I did it	0
So Im going to take both of these numbers and Im going to break them up	0
Anyone else missing	0
Oh this	0
And were going to get x equals four	0
As were working through these algebra problems its super helpful to think back to the warmup from today	0
I like it because I can tell you ve figured out different things we ve done in math and ways we ve used our brains	0
He did have more	0
Yep	0
One divided by seven you get the same number as if you divided this by this	0
Yes	0
If somethings wrong we need to make them match	0
One glass of water but you have two	0
Okay	0
Jen	0
I didnt that one piece	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Charlie has a great one	0
I understand you got it by multiplying by 3	0
Okay Ill do 3 is a common factor of 12 and 15 so I have 4 and 5	0
Would you please fill out that top part	0
Very precious time	0
No I didn t	0
Thats true	0
You do not look at this unless this number tells me that has to raise because Im rounding and I m always rounding to the next number	0
Its the exact same math as we were doing when it was all numbers it just looks weirder to your brain	0
Its outside of the one to 1	0
Another two	0
Okay so if you did long division you can find out this way	0
Then you could multiply it to get how much	0
Yes	0
When you are done completing this rule  Nope not starting yet so I dont know why you started	0
Okay so Ive given my little skip people there are four people that is how many people I need to share this pizza this pie with	0

So down here will be money equals 100 minus	0
Seven eight and 56	0
The coordinate plane is also in that poster up in between the doors over there	0
We know a prediction is correct because the X and Y coordinates double	0
The line would be down here	0
Sarah sweet girl we moved right into math honey so go ahead	0
What does this do Mr G	0
Make sure and stand when youre done	0
I need you just to practice placing these on the line	0
You could have a half and then two fourths	0
So adding this extra cut we multiplied them by two	0
My groups that have not done number one I want you to work on that	0
Awesome	0
Just a couple of small mistakes	0
Now we get to see if we get to spend or save	0
Another 10 years	0
Three fourths	0
Lets take a look at our title for this	0
You take your two values	0
you have an account	0
I gonna change it now	0
We have been talking for the past like this whole week weve been talking about using common multiples and common factors and weve been talking about Okay this problem we know uses common factors	0
Then you would want to do 26	0
Okay	0
In this problem the denominator is five so	0
Who is the first one that can prove that they know how to turn improper fractions into mixed numbers	0
That was my bad	0
Because then I look at five times a half and I see that were multiplying	0
Now were going to do our 90 times three	0
Okay	0
result the way you would like to eh name it	0
Yeah	0
Four and five	0
How much	0
Its person Bs turn to talk	0
Red	0
Sure	0
It takes a lot	0
Do I write it with a decimal	0
Do you have any questions	0
Were going to do four examples today so example number one were going to start off with	0
So so what if so here they have times three divided by five and with multiplication and division you can do them in either order	0
So this one is a function and its a linear function	0
Im going to give you a few seconds to think about it	0
Oh	0
Theres also 10 pieces of information here	0
So its okay	0
I know that as time has gone on theres fewer things that deal with cash but I have a feeling you guys still get pretty excited when you get to deal with any kind of money	0
Hi Havanah	0
I see no work	0

That would be on a bottom line it would be on the X axis	0
Look at all those other words clear specific and concise	0
Very cool	0
Okay	0
Please draw it	0
He draws a picture of the book on the coordinate grip	0
So I want us to to try it on this	0
We divide both sides by two so the inequality is X is less than seven	0
Remember all were doing is multiplying	0
The two variables are how many rides youve taken and how many points are left	0
So therefore I have my remainder	0
The exercise were referring to in the textbook is tenofour	0
Well well you re bothering her ok well you ve got a  meter stick right here help us with this	0
They actually doublechecked their answer	0
Hands down	0
Were writing down our thinking	0
Mhmm	0
Well yes	0

We have five bunches of daisies	0
Go ahead and do the next one	0
Let me see uh Michelle and Ankur were you about to oh you re working on it OK	0
And you also know how much bigger	0
Much better	0
You dont need to say it	0
Multiplying them	0
Im going to give you a chance just to see what you come up with for partial products	0
I also liked that you guys said comparison earlier	0
I found something bad on the back of my white board	0
All right	0
Im going to get my handy dandy whiteboard	0
Hara started counting from 10 but there may be people who started counting from this side	0
Ok I want you to think about this train	0
Erik remembers it differently	0
Yes	0
So youre doing 225 and 226	0
Okay	0
Using partial quotients division	0
160 yards	0
Thats what the problem was	0
Scroll up	0
Oh three times	0
At least at least one or more of the interior angles is greater than 180 degrees	0
Hurry up	0
Okay so make sure that you record the number model underneath and check with your neighbor to see if you guys come up with the same answer	0
Estimating looks like that it is rounding	0
We go back to Erik s idea no it was Alan s idea	0
Ms Rossi right here	0
If we had a bucket of apples I want you to figure out what those what the answer would be to those problems	0
Thats not thirds my friends	0
If we reflected B over the Y axis that would be over here	0
I wanted to absolutely make sure okay	0
Now were going to	0
Eight	0
Welcome them over	0
I want you to go ahead and graph that new sailboat and then well see if it really does look	0
We dont change our denominator so we get 65	0
So this is what Ive actually been working with Emiliano on because this is what hes been doing lately on imagine math	0
But  as Jeff said if you line them up he showed all possibilities  and nothing in between	0
I draw tenths	0
That would be for you to come up with another way to explain your thinking	0
I m not going to explain too much about it because I want us to really think about what s going happen over the next couple of days	0
No no Landon	0
So that would be 21 remainder three	0
Wait if you scroll down maybe on the other one no	0
Okay	0
Yes look at this	0
Youre welcome	0
My friends Im proud of you	0

And on this page 177 there are some problems that I want you to complete as well	0
Any letter in the alphabet will work	0
Ill get you your stuff in a second	0
Then you went to 57	0
Maybe even before that we counted by 10	0
You may absolutely use your fraction circles if they will help you	0
and you can go ahead and copy 1A	0
I heard it a different way	0
Oh wow	0
That says to me A times B times B times B	0
Erase the ones I wrote on the top too	0
One	0
Youre not behind or anything	0
Youre doublechecking one anothers answers	0
Okay	0
Oh I know	0
Okay	0
Uh the second	0
For the last question youve got to write your equations	0
We added all those up	0
You need to think of those as walls pretend walls	0
How many times is 10 to go into 30	0
Okay	0
What are you doing	0
But since its the first time were playing this today you may use this	0
And this is a slope of positive two	0
But for our purposes today you are going to be using ordered pairs of numbers which have an x coordinate and a y coordinate in that order	0
Good	0
If you ever take an art class if you decide to become an engineer if you try to fix or build anything in your home when you have to do it yourself	0

Okay	0
In a parking lot 16 of the cars are blue	0
Right	0
If we took some time to draw it it would definitely make sense	0
Okay if you need sciSors youre going to need to come see me real quick	0
I need you to help	0
So youre exactly right	0
Alright boys and girls	0
Yes there is some paper in the folder over here	0
Youre welcome	0
But first were just gonna play around and theres certain rules that you have to learn when you deal with exponents	0
Were starting on the easy side	0
All right	0
I want to slow down a little bit on this one	0
Oh yes	0
If you add nine to both sides you get 8x10	0
And you know what he told me	0
No	0

No youre here	0
Over 10 up to 300	0
Okay hold on	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
You need 12 minus you need loosing 12 per week	0
Its probably going to have an x1 as one of its factors	0
Ok	0
And were gonna talk about what these numbers letters with numbers mean	0
All you mathematicians here	0
Okay	0
Then hes got zero should have 06	0
12 each week is minus  minus 12W	0
If you finish I would like you to play fractions topic addition on your Chromebooks addition	0
If you are drawing a picture this would be like two groups of a pouch and three coins	0
Thank you Michael	0
Didnt have to do any borrowing We just did counting up	0
Awesome	0
Okay	0
So y equals 2xplus three	0
Lets have a look	0
I can do that	0
Yes I had a student when I taught	0
Hey guys this is beautiful	0
Better they all doubled their score	0
Okay you need to make sure you are following these steps	0
If you would like to you can	0
Concerts are very cool experiences that you can go to	0
Water	0
Maybe I could pick this up so I could see	0
Thats what youre doing and Im going to give you one that we are going to be discussing and sharing	0
You can rub out what you had here	0
Alright	0
Yes you did	0
Two four	0

Thank you for taking a risk	0
Finish up drinking your sodas and eating your lunch	0
Now Im gonna show you this one	0
Now	0
Very good and you said the answer twoeighths	0
I did 8X3 which is 8X3	0
Yes	0
So what sounds like to me Camille is that youre breaking up your your 25	0
Thats 95 plus nine	0
Look at how it is lined up here	0
Dan Stephen	0
Perfect	0
Okay	0
But if in all if he had done that if hed known that there were 27 cups he would have been correct	0
Well thanks for asking	0
Alright so lets watch	0
Draw it with pencil and a triangular protractor	0
Okay	0
And well be doing a lot of thinking privately by ourselves and then sharing with a partner and then sharing out loud	0
Okay please turn to page 85 and then mark 130 in your SRB	0
Really today is about what systems can we put in place to make that easier	0
Make it smaller	0
So that means Im going to end up turning it into that	0
This one is a practice	0
Get that notebook opened up to page six please	0
Negative one to one	0
If you think theyre different I want you to think of a reason why theyre different because these are separate pictures	0
Make sure you put your SRP away	0
Were gonna have the discussion	0
No 1235	0
So if you re done and you re waiting  you might want to think about a second one	0
So he can tell you	0
Number one I really appreciate the conversations and helping each other out in the groups today	0
All right	0
The magnet in here and thats what helps that turn	0
Thats your first point	0
Youre starting to remember	0
Oh here you go like really open your eyes	0
I dont know	0
Excellent job	0
All right	0
Heres what youre going to do	0
Okay	0
With the area when you draw six lines and five lines thats basically five times six	0
I think I did	0
I have a question because I m confused	0
All right first of all lets complete the title	0
And if it helps you to write it down you can	0
Justin and	0
I didnt write the group names	0
No I dont want you to do anything down there I just want to see your model	0
So Im starting out with 14 or one half sorry were writing fractions that are all equivalent to a half	0
Do the  one	0
It is not stupid	0
Hes a senior	0
matches up with 15 kilometers in real life	0
And then these sides are equal because its a parallelogram	0
Alright thanks MatiasYay	0
When I stack them on top of each other theyre all equal in size	0
The last one on your own	0
All right	0
Carlos youre doing a lot of writing but youre not doing a lot of talking because nobody  doing anything because youre just writing away	0
We asked the question how many Netflix movies do you watch in one month	0
And then 50 times four is ads another two zero	0
One third technically isnt on this side oh yeah it is its number seven	0
Okay cool	0
On three	0
It changed	0
That would be one meter	0
Julia turn your microphone off	0
And so you could name it like angle one or something	0
You have to stay here	0
So this angle plus this angle add up to 180	0
Thirty point one one one	0
I need to move a bit more	0
Right	0
You were here last lesson	0
Greater than because what were multiplying by is bigger than one	0
Shh	0
Yes	0
How about 10 400ths	0
Oh that means of	0
If you could just stay back please	0
So we know that from B to B its not a horizontal line its not a vertical line	0
Okay	0
Because they cant doesnt it typically cancel out	0
And then since youre trying to do 10 equal pieces its helpful to divide it in half first and then to divide each of your halves into five pieces	0
Okay	0
Lets add column one	0
All right	0
And I understand why you asked me if we should leave the planner out	0
So zero comma a number that means its your y intercept	0
Write your coordinates	0
And then before you even do the zero figure for you do the zero figure think about the other patterns because thatll help you will find what the numbers should be for the zero with figure	0
like the fundraising balls these are kind of oriented the other way but its the same idea	0
Okay	0
Do not leave me	0
This ones 10 to six	0
What is it for sir	0
You want to be in a room	0
Now I will know I am successful when I can round decimals upper back using a number line grid and a rounded shortcut on journal page 125	0
35 and 710	0
Okay	0
Your mouths arent open youre opening your book to page 135	0
You listen too ok  listen to her argument	0
Right inbetween zero and one	0
I want everybody to write your first goal at the top of page seven	0
You can go and sit down now guys	0
If we go back to slide number one and we count by 9s we could say 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 and 90	0
Give me five	0
So were going to start off and we want to know the gist of this problem	0
Weve only got one more to go for today	0
Yes 8 x 5 is 40x 9 is 360	0
In this row right here	0
Without talking can you go fast fast fast	0
Right	0
Yes	0
That is always an option with math	0
Now before we do that its a really good idea for us to be able to have some strategies to be able to use some mental math to estimate our answers	0
So your equation should be this negative two because your lines going down by two every time and then plus 10 because thats your y intercept	0
Because thats not an area model	0
Plus negative 20 in parentheses to the second power plus negative 10 to the first power plus zero to the tenth power	0
I like that hes questioning so we have at six the grocery stores at 6	0
The 89 and 163 and 88	0
And then I said well two of them is 18 then three of them would be 27 and so I took the bottom row is 27 and the top row is also going to be 27	0
Oh I just got this	0
Ben I just sense Bens getting a little lost here	0
Okay here we go	0
You could do 2 divided by 1 or you could do 6 divided by three either way you get 2	0
Well because Im moving around	0
I saw some of you guys write 3 and 75 cents on your desks as well divided by 5 and thats another great route to go	0
Lionel it is okay to unmute and say I dont know	0
Im happy to work with anybody who would like some support up at the front table	0
So you can now join me on the floor	0
Four	0
Group B took this much	0
She made sense of the problem	0
Were going to do one of these together	0
Okay	0
This is all by yourself to see what you know	0
Yeah	0
Okay one two three show me your boards	0
The whole thing	0
Hi	0
No no no	0
Mine isnt perfect by any stretch of the imagination	0
He wrote it on a piece of paper	0
I did it the same but inauidble	0
That bathroom light is off	0
so this one would have looked like instead of 49 It would have been 49000 because I am multiplying the hundreds now which makes my pieces smaller	0
Excellent	0
Okay	0
We need to match one milliliter of blue paint and three milliliters of yellow paint	0
So were going to focus on how do we deconstruct	0
That is what you are doing	0
Okay	0

I dont think the mics heard you last time because youre talking like mice	0
Thats a good one	0
While you guys were working I did the horns and I did this part	0
Plus three	0
Okay I also have a lab bless you someone is sneezing a lot today I also have a lab sheet for you	0
You just have to get here fast	0
The only thing I would encourage you to do a little bit is show some kind of model	0
x minus four and x plus seven equals zero	0
Shh Katie	0
You know what to do	0
All right moving on	0
Hopefully it doesnt hurt you	0
No it would be 18	0
That s what  you have to figure out	0
Heres our next problem	0
This is real interesting	0
Im going to give you a little time to think about that	0
I dont want you to have any conversation with anybody else about it	0
Wait	0
Greater than 8000	0
takeaway x it keeps this positive 2x	0
Why dont you take care of that during a Dalton hour	0

Diameter is all the way across	0
Lets stay focused please	0
This ones going up from left to right	0
Two times three is six plus one that equals f of three	0
Then we would know that the surface area of this square was 144	0
Finally there are some uh uh special uh questions for you to think about	0
Basically we don t have enough information	0
You and your partner	0
Numerator	0
I think I have it	0
Perfect	0
Awesome	0
I want to be even more specific than that	0
How is that going to work because its now three steps	0
You don t  know the problem I made up	0
I just move the stuff to the other side by doing the inverse operation	0
Do it that way	0
One pack would be six	0
Thanks for doing that	0
That was not what I was trying to do	0
Your mother came	0

all the time	0
Okay lets go back to In the parking lot 16 of the cars are blue there are four blue cars	0
And so all we have to do is to divide by 10 to get to one	0
I couldnt do it to the end	0
On a number line it would be closer to two than it is to three	0
Okay	0
Yes I am	0
So the next one you can think about is on page 104 problem number four	0
Listen  You take this  with you	0
I think you had the first one that you wrote I think you had it and then you might have erased it	0
I don t know	0
We came up with 14  14  14	0

Just go	0
Oh yes thats what I said	0
All right	0
And then well talk about them all together	0
See you soon	0
So Im going to draw a line	0
Grab one those the ones up there and write the number sentence for me please	0
It think we have twentytwo here and we have eight here	0
If not I need to erase it	0
Would you present this part	0
Thats the one we just did	0
Try to change it	0
All right so today we are doing lesson 62	0
All right so well be doing that at recess if we do not complete it	0

So now Im going to read you what they wrote	0
Let me think about that for a quick second	0
So the strategy I used is I put the greater than on one side and then the less than on the other and for the greater than I moved the point to the right and for the less than I moved the point to the left	0
As a matter of fact Let me give you a fresh one to save you some time	0
Okay the other way you could think about this problem you could say like Oh well actually I noticed in these points that the X the sorry the y value is always five	0
Why do we even have to do this	0
Well first now write the number model you think theyre asking you to write up here	0
The Euclid City Council is developing parts with geometric shapes	0
Because they dont want it though	0
When youre done with each  and youre going to have to your screenshot	0
Right	0
Now please start to draw the cute little guy	0

So to go from T to S we go up four over three	0
Ms Koski does a really great job every single day of writing down what were learning in math also up here	0
We had it inside the circle	0
So were going to do one problem where we kind of look at I just want to see who can do it without the rectangle just to see	0
Now  before you model it you might think in your head before you begin  to model it what you is bigger and if so if one is bigger by how  much	0
Here we go	0
So theyre just plateaued right there	0
In my head	0
Hes calling you	0
Ill read through the instructions and girls read through the instructions as I go through it	0
Okay	0
Were going to do the same comparison of minutes and miles and Easton help me figure out what needs to go in the first column of Jadas ratio table	0

you have to bring in your tens	0
So its really like the average of X the average of Y	0
Fraction products	0
Nobody erase	0
I just want to show you why it works	0
Maybe how much orange juice and soda do you have	0

Oh you got to start at the origin which is school	0
Right	0
Team five pick one person to get a computer	0
Ok good morning	0
Youre discussing	0
Okay	0
Calculate the diameter and in this similar problem calculate the radius	0
It almost looks like a rhombus but we dont know if its rhombus or not so its parallelogram	0
Yes	0
Im going to say that one more time	0
Okay so this would be starting at six for the y intercept and then you go down by a half every time and then in the negatives would go up by half because that would continue our line	0
No	0
Its going to be messed with in some simple way	0
Those are both just flat	0
Okay	0
That works	0
This one I ve seen a lot	0
If you want to test out coordinate rules or if over the next couple days youre like  Im not really understanding coordinate rules and what different things mean  These rules can be changed by these sliders up here	0

You two are partners	0
So I can divide a fraction by a fraction using a picture or a diagram kind of the same thing or algorithm	0
19  19  19  19	0
You did a nice job thinking through that and thinking through the steps as you were solving that	0
He needs help	0
Okay	0
Ok 3 or 4 people are  volunteering	0
Good	0
My f isnt quite alone yet I need to now divide by two which means I just divide this by two	0
If you dont show the check its a two out of four even if you did it right	0
Three two one	0
Yeah	0
Okay	0
Yes is there in February than in January	0

Hes questioning his thinking	0
Different versions of the expanded form	0
Negative three and a negative 10	0
Okay so there was our original book	0
Now think about applying that rule	0
Yes	0
Then now we can subtract one and three sixths because now the numerator is bigger than the denominator	0
Okay	0
So just get the info on there	0
So lets see how were doing here	0
Well come back to those	0
Oh I hear a lot of noise I shouldnt	0

For those of you who want to check I have answer booklets over here	0
Im missing a lot of explanations crew	0
Then if you dont need it any more bring you box scissors tape measure to the table	0
Zero	0
Equation three and equation four	0
So its a drop for this problem	0
And then on slide four um do your buttons solve the equation when you arrive at the correct solution	0
Okay so then you just have to multiply	0
Next we have the engineers	0
Well yes the last one you did was correct	0
Okay lastly square	0
So youre going to need a partner interpreting and comparing fractions to collect the cards	0
The units will tell you if its part of the same whole	0
Okay	0
So thats the big idea for our objective for today	0
He thinks he s  going to argue for why he s changing his mind	0
This is going to get more challenging	0
Hold on	0

Okay length times	0
Well go back to this	0
Yes	0
Show me your boards in three two one zero	0
You dont get	0
Boys and girls just so I feel youre on the right track what I was hoping my group would You have to figure out first of all how many strings Each violin has four strings and each student is going to have four strings	0
Your y intercept should be 03	0
So weve got about 30 minutes left and I want to talk about what your homework is and and then give you some time to actually get going on that	0
10	0
Youre welcome	0
Your horns are going to be expanded form	0
Figure out what you know read the problem in your own words	0
Look now I just stepped on Oopsie	0
All right we re gonna move on   I think you guys for the feel for the likelihood line	0
33	0
And you have to set up the circle	0
Therefore zero is equal to minus one	0
Okay	0
You dont get it yet so I cannot let you go with your partners yet	0
Lets do it	0
Awkwardly worded	0
How about	0
Tia youre going make an account there	0
Okay	0
What if I take  it away then you guys cant see	0
Were going to multiply eight times three and three times three which gives us 924	0
And then we will go one step further	0
Were going to talk about it two different ways today but hopefully youll have some strategies	0
Heres how the test is going to work	0
You need to turn towards me and youre not talking to him	0
You can do it in your notebook if youd like to	0
So today I can play a game to practice multiplying and dividing decimals by powers of 10	0
Shes gone for five days	0
how I got the equation or the answer	0
Thats fine	0
Thanks Frankie	0
Now this is just an alternate way of setting out your working	0
We need to	0
So one half or 05	0
Excellent job	0
wants to cover a board with fabric	0
Oh wait no I did it right	0
Camiela youre still not right move down by Liz please	0
Lillian needs to buy  112 bottles of water for the school party	0
Maybe Ill put it over here	0
One two three four	0
You three boys got it	0
Um if we are looking at our rise and our run so the rise is actually going down	0
All of them ask you to do some dividing	0
Okay and this is the vector number or the slope	0
Just do the problems on the board	0
Dont do it	0
Thats very  lovely	0
Jane has two pieces of pita bread	0
We are saying for a hundred right	0
And um there  were all kinds of interesting things happening uh and I  read some of the papers of the different kinds of thinking  you were doing and um Sarah had built a new model that I  hadnt seen for one of her problems and Kimberly and  Audra and Erin and Jackie and oh just such exciting  things I mean how can we get to all of this	0
Who did I give Amayas math journal to	0
There we go	0
Ones and threes are you coaching or writing	0
Look at the piece of paper I just gave you	0
Yes	0
Lets graph these points	0
Okay so then lets count to see how much each person got	0
Are we only supposed to do one square or all of them	0
Lets see thats really not quite joined on	0
It doesnt have to be red	0
Now the last quick check you should always do is run through your multiplication facts in your head	0
And were going to be doing a lot of combining today as well	0
I don t know if they have  convinced Dr Davis	0
Thanks for showing that	0
So now you guys found the equivalent fraction for fivetenths	0
Yeah	0
Nice	0
Im going to add the	0
Round four and 254 hundredths to the nearest hundredth	0
Tuesday Wednesday we finish up this section	0
One of you is doing multiples the other is doing factors	0
Okay everyone sit down	0
Guys just sit right here	0
Because Mariah explained it very clear	0
Find me another way of showing 23	0
So let me write this in the chat	0
Circle the possibilities on your map	0
I think its 31	0
Its whatever you want to do	0
Yes	0
Here is the theory that this comes from	0
Okay	0
3x1 is 3	0
Ill show you when you get there	0
So thats example one	0
Obtuse	0
Anna	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
How is it working	0
So three is right here and the idea is that you want a positive three slope which you did perfectly	0
Im sorry	0
5 5 5	0
Orange comes second	0
We have the library ice cream shop	0
And also of course they are using letters but there were some people who formed mathematical expressions a little differently	0
Okay Clay go ahead and bring your paper or your whiteboard up here	0
Hhis name was Rainbow and he gave birth to babies	0
And we cannot do that	0
While you guys were talking I was listening to you and you were talking about the size of your groups and you could have also done your number of groups but it seems like you guys were looking at the size of your groups which is great when youre doing fractions	0
Sure yes	0
Yeah	0
Okay	0
All right Mr Michael this ones yours	0
Your answer is right but just be more specific	0
Make sure if I was looking up Oops sorry it does this with this mic tuition	0
I want you to think about rules and patterns right now	0
So we would want to backtrack that	0
Im going ask questions	0
This one takes a little bit more thought	0
Aaron can you join Cooper and Mia	0
Maybe you can all  come together	0
Okay so your assignment did I get those page back	0
Youre not graphing hers	0
I would argue she knows a lot because she got the problem right and she modeled it in a way that we can understand	0
Theres one more that Im thinking of that I havent seen yet	0
How many of you got nine hundred twenty five	0
Okay	0
Didnt I have to stay behind now	0
She knows it s complicated	0
Er here there we do times 10 that like after we have no more commas here	0
It will look better if you divide three from that side	0
The two numbers so were multiplying them together are the same	0
Everybody think about it	0
No	0
Fill in the blank make a true number sentence	0
There we go	0
I ate 38	0
Try yeah yeah	0
That its just a matter of how many do we need to attach	0
All right	0
You think you can handle it	0
So let me open	0
So you seem to have two rules one when you have a half one you don t have a half	0
I think you said it correctly I just didnt hear you right	0
If you have an answer its not a whole lot to add	0
All right	0
And then yeah so let me show you what Im talking about	0
Make sure youre nice to him if he makes mistake	0
Okay	0
Then I needed to color in two	0
All right	0
The second I dont have to discuss we actually had solved that one	0
Yeah it was	0
and I said do the angles and radius	0
Oh	0
Or it should look like this composing	0
Well just make sure you are there	0
Geometry is actually the study of points lines line segments and rays as it pertains to making shapes	0
Lets try Wait the 18 dont fit on the 13	0
Five four three two one zero	0
I can say 6 x 1	0
Because theres six zeros	0
And then 14 is a function because wherever you draw your vertical line its only going to cross the red line once as long as you keep your line vertical	0
She needs help figuring these last two out	0
See if you can trick somebody else	0
We didnt	0
Yessy yessy	0
Theyre selling hot dogs	0
Thats awesome	0
You need to be smart about it	0
You dont use it you lose it	0
So in your problem youre trying to figure out how much carpet you needed	0
Okay	0
No graphing calculators but we will have a set of regular scientific ones listen please Im not done just sit sit and listen	0
youre good	0
I think the answer could be around 10	0
I looked at the whole number and I looked into those	0
That means answer questions that means ask questions	0
So I could say 13x10 so my answer should be around 130	0
Yes	0
So what we need to do now that we are going to combine all of these is we need to make sure to get a common denominator	0
Okay	0
Thank you friend	0
Winston Phillipa Katie	0
We had four pizzas sharing with five people	0
Ok I see that you switched what you made um your model uh but  you showed me that one half is still bigger than a third and you still  believe that	0
I cant hear you sorry	0
Im a visual person	0
10 or 50 cents	0
Thank you friends	0
Just show the class	0
Lets look at our	0
Five four three two one zero	0
Hunter and Edgar	0
But hold on a minute	0
You cant just write it like that	0
New sailboat two not new sailboat one	0
Oh Oh	0
Yeah why is it nine	0
Its because it said I found 17 cents underneath the couch cushion now I have to add into my PiggyBank	0
Lucas good ears	0
0681 and 068 should be what you have on your whiteboards	0
Okay	0
You cant go sub right there	0
And then were just going to go up by ones	0
Yeah	0
She wants to have the same number of plates and cups	0
Okay	0
Yeah 24 will work	0
Okay please check your zeros	0
Right	0
Yes read the text for the problem above and it will show you everything	0
Im going to go ahead and close our rooms though	0
Then I subtracted by the first column	0
Oh what did I say before I started writing	0
So theyre not actually things that we are dividing up theyre just a space to show the difference between each of the pieces	0
So I am going to have you take some think time	0
But over there you can see it right	0
Okay I got it	0
So that means square root of nine	0
So Y is equal because its a hypotenuse its a root of X squared plus C squared	0
No I dont understand it	0
You did	0
Okay	0
Its a way of writing a number as the sum of the values of each digit	0
It actually we have designed it in a way that it should be able to give you a grade	0
Now now there s a sense the sort of a two sided ah thing about ah secrets	0
Its still 5 to 2 but one of them is now switched between oil and tomato sauce	0
Youre good to go	0
So one third if you start here you go up one over three down one backwards three down one backwards three	0
And then for the newer version one it would just be just more wider and longer	0
Exactly organization	0
Remember were looking for 100 participation on every single question	0
Yes	0
Right	0
And hands together but dont erase	0
I need to find a common denominator between 9 and 12	0
So you guys were not being silly because youre going to have to use these words when you actually go to explain your rule	0
so we have to figure out what they want us to label our tick marks	0
No	0
All right	0
You can decide to have it be super strong or you can decide to have it be a watereddown version of koolaid	0
One divided by one twelfth	0
I can see	0
But only on the right the five X it will reappear	0
One hundred eighty five	0
I dont hear much talking going on	0
Heres your next one	0
Okay	0
No	0
And then I get to five that tells me that I have found all the factors of 25	0
The point of todays experiment with letting you become the Mr Parker is this	0
Do it the easy way	0
And now round it up to the nearest tenth	0
All right take off if you did the same strategy if you used the same strategy	0
Yeah	0
I dont know well its just going to move forward and do it	0
This will be mistaken easily you will get this wrong easily	0
In fact its quite messy but its not easy to do with this little light pen	0
So like if it has this in it then you know its the right angle	0
Yeah w plus one equals v So if we know w plus one equals V W is one plus one equals v So two equals v Yay	0
Alfie good job with your first one	0
Yes	0
That s just like changing it a little bit	0
Then you can do C Okay friends do the rest of this page on  your own	0
Now I do 23 so I go 1 2 23 and I want to see what I double shaded	0
And then you are doing your new sailboat four	0
Marketing	0
So now I have to come up with something times 11 Thats going to get me closest to 14	0
That should be okay	0
I am so confused	0
Good	0
Okay I love that I go from a two to a five	0
So this is X equals zero	0
Okay	0
Thats a great question	0
18 is a common multiple but Wyatt is right that six is a least common multiple and that might have been a little bit less work for us	0
I see you put one one hundredth right there	0
So were going to look at our information on our table to figure out how to get our number of avocados to 20	0
In green	0
Excuse me Gregoire	0
And the notation they invent when you see  that arrow that arrow means it keeps on going and if you wanted to show more of them to  make you point or explain it to somebody you could but that is a notation they use for  convenience	0
Were getting there	0
Okay	0
but I did know what to divide by	0
Oh its more	0
And then youre going to have most of class tomorrow to work on the test	0
Give me five	0
Im going to give you one minute and 30 seconds	0
Youre not a new person Ian	0
Now skip count  Hey Caleb	0
So you can see all those things	0
They were magnets	0
Our problem is Larry has half of a fruit bar	0
Just refresh your memory were going to be using two things today vertical angles	0
Onethird Two thirds three thirds four thirds	0
Nicely done Alani	0
Yes because he had to multiply by three to get here	0
When x goes up by one thats our slope you go up by three halves or one and a half	0
We never said anything about the opposites	0
As some people star to finish come see me to get a signature	0
they dont disagree but theyre still not  following	0
Right	0
Name on your paper	0
So thats what were going to be verifying at least for this first part today as the parallel part	0
Thats very neat	0
Once youre doing sign up	0
Yes	0
No	0
No	0
Okay	0
At the beginning it isnt that evident to find this this calculation	0
It says 110	0
I can rename mixed numbers	0
After you solve each box you come to me if each box gives you a sCadey face congratulations youre on the right track	0
That would be 42 divided by two which is 21 so that would totally work	0
Beautiful	0
I want you to think about multiplication process	0
So yes	0
This is how I can use my multiplication chart to help me solve multiplication problems	0
So lets go back to this	0
Three	0
While I write this for those of you guys that already have it written what I want you to write is this in your notebook under adding mixed numbers	0
Now my hope is that you can do some mental math to solve at this point but we are going to talk about our diagram and how we can draw a diagram to show this or a model	0
Okay same with nine times six	0
Speaking of that symmetry	0
So go ahead and do it	0
I know Im just going to excuse you from it	0
Raise your hands for this one	0
Do we write the place its in or the place of value	0
Twentyfive	0
Oh we are	0
So we want this to go down evenly	0
Lets write that instead of K Paul please complete it	0
You should be listening to me right now	0
How many will be left over	0
Okay	0
And this would be two and three fifths	0
We didnt use it for anything	0
And then I think the next four examples are just draggables	0
Thats not just take one when you need one	0
So we can make three patties and then half a patty with the leftover one eighth pound	0
Okay	0
I think its four negative one	0
Thats how you show	0
Got it	0
Get your whiteboards out please	0
Awesome	0
Okay awesome	0
Yeah Im thinking	0
Okay thank you so much for letting me know that in the chat	0
Okay	0
Show	0
Were going to do this for different types of problems its not always going to be division problems	0
And you guys are like Oh	0
As soon as I come over here	0
Sure	0
In order to find the surface area we need to find the radius first	0
You can recycle that	0
And then you pick another one to do and I would do the easy one	0
Watch let me show you	0
What we described is that it is larger	0
Someones starting off right away with the slope someone starting off right away filling out the table	0
Opps	0
Excellent	0
Now were thinking	0
If youre moving right one youd write one comma down four would be negative four	0
Now what do you notice about that picture at the bottom	0
Just write down three	0
Think about realworld situations where you use multiplication discuss with a partner write down your ideas and be prepared to share them	0
Its a different I know	0
Miriam did I put you in a group	0
Absolutely	0
Ive got this	0
Because 15 times five equals 75	0
You may do B C and D Go	0
I want you to write this in your journals	0
Start working with exponents	0
You might want to but you could be here all afternoon	0
These are really good conversation skills	0
I see Jessica has two and Andrew has two some  of you are building a few models	0
All right	0
Youre going to start over here	0
Hmm	0
Lets draw a picture	0
Im sorry not my job	0
This would be at the end	0
Okay	0
So if were looking for thank you Connor and Alicia if were looking for a time that first date that both boys will have a game that would be a  multiple problem and Alicia is right	0
Two thirds	0
Hey guys if youre just drawing on just do the best you can because I have three drawn on	0
A couple people  already did when they were talking about it  they answered it for me but Id like you to  think about that for a minute	0
Of course you may	0
Good	0
Only one person is in the I do not understand bucket	0
Okay	0
Okay so were going to do one example problem	0
Now this is crazy but you already know how to do this	0
Yes very good	0
Okay who take me in the chat if you can tell me 20 times six	0
Oh that is not what you had in the beginning	0
Niko or Julia turn your microphones on or I will be marking you absence	0
You can start over	0
Okay Im going to start reading	0
Sometimes when you look at something the next day you have a new look on it and you can see Brandon T how to make it better	0
The way youll show me youre ready is by being on 145 with your pencils down because I havent asked you to start yet	0
The recipe is doubled	0
Two thirds is equivalent to zero and 66 hundredths with that little line above it	0
Its just your hair	0
Let me make sure I understand this	0
Okay so lets test x equals four and see if it works	0
Whats going to happen is when I put these three problems up on the board youre going to just look at the first one its going to tell you to do something	0
Good morning class	0
Shes like 30 miles from the Canadian border and its really cool up there	0
I feel like I was totally gone for first semester and I have no idea what youre talking about	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
5 10 15	0
While I walk around and pass out some PAMPs and stuff to you and some unit circle stuff I want you in your group to just try something	0
In your graph paper this is what it should look like	0
One person in this class I think Rory is the only one who either understands knows or cares about geometry in this class	0
Okay	0
67 hundreds	0
First step	0
Yes correct	0
Okay thats an algorithm but I want an area model way we did it	0
We might need to take	0
So lets look at our objective a little bit today	0
Her denominator is not changing	0
Then I did 367 x 9 to get 3303	0
Okay okay	0
Mm hm	0
So so far weve gone through five people and theres only two open lockers	0
All right	0
Sorry Im showing the wrong tab	0
Anybody have any questions on this slide before I move ahead	0
Thats what I was afraid of	0
How much they pay	0
Yes	0
And sometimes you will find that theres a bunch of data points that we need to work with	0
Assuming you should feel that little nervousness because youre trying really hard	0
Together friends we are going to skip down to 2B	0
Fourteen plus nine equals	0
Green	0
Perfect	0
We are actually going to graphics doing it the way that I said	0
Oh I see that equation	0
Hunter I dont know if we can get closer than that	0
So Mary gets this one	0
Okay	0
It doesnt help	0
Mhmm	0
Its three	0
Ok I have the different people from the same two groups	0
For the perpendicular line remember if its 4 for the slope then this one needs to be negative Because this ones positive this ones negative and you have to flip it	0
Would that be too nice of me though	0
All righty okay	0
pull out your math journals and turn to page 60 you are going to turn to page 60	0
All right lets all come and get it	0
I need your attention up here	0
Okay Im going to stop you right there	0
And this person 100	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Okay so  coordinates are written as ordered pairs of numbers or letters and numbers	0
What does MSA stand for	0
This one should be doubling the number of the original pair	0
So lets put that one in there as six put that one in there is two	0
13 days	0
Number one says write their ages	0
Okay	0
So those of you who did not stand up in disagreement we might need to work together to make sure were adding accurately	0
Thank you	0
Some people said yes	0
Im ready to hear some questions because you can maybe  keep thinking of more	0
Number one	0
Go	0
Were going to figure out what the information means and were going to be making some predictions based on that information	0
So when Im looking okay hold on one step back	0
All right	0
Nicely done Emmerson	0
That is not what I want to do	0
Um	0
175 centimeters over x	0
Okay	0
For right now Im going to skip Brendans because Brendan has three people in his house	0
Yes of course only it hasnt been explained over here yet	0
If youre in the room can you put your Chromebook at a 45 degree angle	0
I know that somebody figured out about  the length of nine meters right Mark you were  working on that	0
All right Kyes my last one Im going to check	0
Okay	0
Perfect	0
The heater	0
Im going tohighlight this	0
So this is actually those are flipped	0
Your first one is correct Leilanie even if it doesnt read as a fraction youre first one is correct still	0
Antonio	0
But then make sure you join the paradigm because thats what were working on now	0
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten	0
No	0
All right	0
20	0
Yeah	0
Hum I want to take a vote again	0
I think it would be much easier for you guys if you always used the same sequence	0
Yeah	0
This is telling you that the whole thing is 17 wide	0
Dont erase	0
Thank you	0
Okay I love your proposal	0
Huh	0
You have to do 45	0
Yeah  and Ill be	0
I do to the top	0
We have all the info we need	0
You have five sides you pentagon	0
Its more	0
That one cancels so C has a removable discontinuity	0
Youre going to show me youre ready just by holding your pencil	0
Then youre going to do a try this and then youre going to do math boxes on page 231	0
You said it hes just doing what youre doing	0
For example I know first Im going to do 30 x 60	0
Here is a way that it comes back	0
Thats getting us off topic isnt it	0
Okay	0
I want you to think about Oh hello what are you doing over there babe	0
Okay open your notes so you can see it	0
number	0
There were going to try and do it in one stage	0
Okay	0
There you go	0
Im trying to challenge you	0
Because they have different	0
Whos missing	0
These are just if you werent here last week	0
Good	0
Remember to go in order tens tens tens ones ones tens ones ones	0
However this is simpler	0
Show me your boards	0
Wow	0
I see one two  three four  five six seven eight nine ten	0
I disagree	0
One and a half	0
Want to do your work on this last question	0
I see youve already written the problem	0
The average in February is 52100 of an inch	0
Youre ignoring this half so this half is the whole and she did two thirds and then onesixth and onesixth	0
And so you know making sure that we either agree or disagree with our partner we justify we talk about other methods that you might have to solve the problem	0
So Kabir P were going to start with you	0
But I already have it here because the mate to it is here	0
Alright	0
Okay	0
Sam said I think your answer is wrong	0
Okay good	0
Okay got it	0
Oh Lilith you were my next stick	0
We must as I told you yesterday we must write down the assigned problems	0
Okay so Im going to write that in slope is negative two	0
4	0
You may uncap your marker and write down on your paper	0
Yeah that s what I did but I didn t invent it somebody told me it	0
Whats up	0
For the first two we are going to use the help of a graph and for the last two were not going to use a graph	0
Wait 6 feet	0
I think that is what Jackie was saying  that you can show your model several ways	0
Twofifths plus threetenths	0
Okay	0
Maybe just point to it	0
Wing it	0
The answer is not 18 24th	0
With nothing we have on here can go on to one hexagon twelve times	0
Because that math vocabulary is going to become more natural to use instead of seeming more forced	0
I couldnt remember	0
Okay	0
Youre going to still need your whiteboard so you can leave them out	0
I want you to tell me what you think the answer of the estimate will be	0
I was trying to type quickly this morning a copy	0
Who is the leader right now	0
Yes	0
I cant give you 10	0
Hm	0
One times two is two and two times two is four and so its twofourths over here and youll get twofourths over here	0
Its the one that says Grade 6 Unit 3 Lesson 13	0
Its okay use your pencil to erase this or here Melissa no just do it on this one	0
Because I think I have to do an observation one of these days	0
Yes grab this rope	0
At first I thought this was two by and then I got	0
Old Navy	0
For every three hexagons there is one trapezoid	0
Its the twentyninth	0
But we have three functions up here	0
Okay you try take out uh clas your classwork exercise book to try to draw	0
Okay umm I have prepared two on your handout but one is okay	0
Thank you	0
Okay	0
Now Im just going to highlight a couple of things	0
Good	0
So each friend gets a half because theres four friends	0
I just wanted to make sure it wasnt a maker	0
Okay	0
I want to get from onehalf to tenths	0
I just need your brain and your eyes	0
So we could cut them in eighths	0
Okay angles go a little bit faster	0
57  five first five along the horizontal and then seven on the veritcal	0
Yes we did	0
Where are we	0
And finally the fingers the digits on the end of the hands	0
It might be complex okay	0
So you go ahead and try to do number one	0
Now lets say this is the better team	0
I know what I have to do	0
All right	0
I didnt get that	0
For this would be point O prime	0
Yes so the first number should not change from this side	0
Game	0
All right	0
All right	0
Six times four that would be 24	0
Today math is fractionof problems	0
Right here	0
And then thats where the bottom number comes from and then you divide them by each other and that gives you what were looking for	0
Practice some equivalent fractions	0
Why dont we work on that together	0
So when we multiply were going to say 2x5 which is 10	0
Thats an awesome strategy	0
Anna did it correctly except she did not call up the next person	0
Why	0
Two times the five and then in the counter direction two times the three	0
That means that 15 boxes would be 120 bars	0
So we have also the last one	0
One two three four	0
Okay	0
Okay so we know that our common denominator is 40	0
And so it crosses twice	0
Ooh a matching game	0
Just underline them with a pencil or something like that	0
Circle the number in the 10s place everyone right now hold your white boards up	0
Okay	0
All right	0
But try to have three equal points	0
This is the one youre solving	0
16	0
Okay	0
No	0
Color in the third now color in two of the fifths	0
Okay thanks for let me know when its when it stops lagging then you can then you can write it in okay	0
Our answer should be three elevenths	0
Right	0
Slide two	0
Okay	0
Tomi nice presentation please	0
And then Id like to what am I trying to say here	0
I like it	0
Pear Deck shared screen Pear Deck shared screen	0
Madison notebook	0
Perfect	0
Good thanks	0
They say its art because theyre using very fine details within their work	0
But you just said that it was correct	0
So pages 179 180 and 181	0
Yeah	0
I would recommend or relax just for a couple minutes and Ill see you back here in just a couple minutes	0
Maybe they were looking to make the problem a little bit easier for themselves	0
Uh I will explain uh that to you next time	0
All right	0
Have a seat	0
Three	0
So the inside of this box is equal to zero	0
Teacher	0
One through five youre going to choose the best estimate	0
Jake is designing a picture for the cover of his reading folder	0
Well it doesnt matter	0
Okay	0
This is a selfchecking slide	0
Thats 22 thats one	0
So before we jump in and we find and use an algorithm to be able to add and subtract were going to use some mental math to circle the two numbers whos sum is closest to zero	0
Hey Im going to track your thinking	0
If  you dont think theres a smaller one you should be able to  show it or at least	0
Plot the point on the grid and connect them using a straight edge	0
I think I have them over here actually	0
This is a new time around	0
Awesome	0
Well lets see	0
Yes	0
Can you say that again	0
Do not second guess that is insane you re 100 percent right	0
So would do the 3 x 9 is 27	0
Okay	0
All right so these are a little bit tricky maybe and lets see what we can figure out for example three	0
Okay then to find the x intercept we just get rid of that stuff	0
Im talking in the right spaces	0
And even here well have the same exponent	0
Go ahead and come over here and put your sticky note up on my board	0
Youre  graders	0
What Id like you to do is work on your own first and see if you understand it	0
Okay	0
Youre at nine and youre here	0
Yes x equals 10	0
Good	0
Ok tell me why Dr Martino was annoyed with  me	0
You could say it s all real numbers except for three or five	0
10 20 30 40 so when I drew mine 10 20 30 40 50 60 went up by 10	0
Theres your big hint	0
Good job	0
So onethird and  twothirds are two fractions you just must know	0
Youre going to make it have what it is missing	0
Congratulations	0
Then were going to be comparing decimals around the decimals	0
Wheres John	0
Our friend Jake hes designing a picture for the cover of his reading folder	0
Tangent of 62 degrees  B over 7	0
youre exactly right	0
Cool	0
We have to remember a story	0
6 meters	0
Why are you crying	0
You just broke those boxes in half	0
Franc Im going to have you and go ahead and sit next to Mariah	0
All right everybody should be back now	0
Mhm yes	0
Okay	0
I wrote down three and I said four	0
So 121	0
My pattern is tens and tens ones and ones	0
Once youve plotted your coordinate grids you need to get a ruler	0
Everyone turn your math journals to page 138	0
That is 25 of the total price of the items youve purchased before they were on clearance	0
Great	0
We still got to do	0
K of eight	0
Im just going to have fractions up to one	0
But you can cut these out	0
Edith let me know if you need help getting logged in sweetie	0
Um as you guys can see uh there is a camera here	0
Same height	0
So you cant take three fourths away from 14	0
Good	0
His small he sells them in is one cup	0
Okay	0
Tenths	0
And they all go fairly quick	0
I have my second team that is showing me using shapes	0
And the third line that one I do want everyone to calculate for now	0
Yeah I like that	0
Thats the title	0
Okay	0
Because whats the first thing you said	0
Three divided by twothirds	0
Its product	0
Alright so today were gonna start on this first side which is converting fractions to decimals and then decimals to fractions	0
Or you can make a table and figure out what the slope is through the points	0
So Nope	0
Not really	0
Down here I should have an answer	0
All of those are different and they all have a different y value	0
Why not	0
Okay	0
so you will do the slides 501 you will do the division Wonderland 501 thats the assessment	0
I just felt like it	0
So each of you will do one example and well go through it really fast and make it right	0
By entering the coordinates	0
You should have split your square the way you folded your paper into thirds and then in half	0
Wyatt	0
While you re working on 3 and 4	0
Well start talking about these things	0
Oh I love how he did his decimal point	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
Yes	0
Look at number three	0
Dont worry you and I are going to do this later	0
Yes the entire page	0
Can you move that trash can over to there so its not in the way and I need the white tables up and the  table up	0
I like your thinking	0
But then I made it and said You can times the X and Y coordinates by four	0
I hear you	0
There is definitely a language to describing geometric figures and you will be asked to do that	0
I dont know Mr G What	0
Interesting	0
So your job match a picture to the multiplication number sentences first youre going to match them all	0
T can we erase our white boards	0
That works in that example but it will not work overall	0
I do want you to pay really good attention because it says how much money should Mr Swanson take to the store to be sure he has enough	0
I figured this out come here	0
And we have a poster now several different ways to prove that 215 equals four and one fifth	0
Hi	0
Good	0
In this case it doesnt matter but if somebody wants speed they typically want minutes per one mile they want the distance to be one	0
That was definitely a memorable concert because it started hailing halfway through	0
Okay number one number two	0
Nine shells	0
Y equals I will copy that one half times 10 plus one	0
So a rectangle has this extra thing all angles out to the 90	0
Okay	0
Use your recipe on page seven if you need a reminder	0
Someone has to	0
So youre saying theres a way of getting these without the calculator	0
So this first one is asking you take this number and multiply it by this number	0
As you finish you are going to stand and Im going to pair you up to talk with a partner	0
Liz argued that its going to look wider	0
Good	0
I got five because five times five is 25	0
Lets have a look	0
You could add the tenths so you could add five of three which is eight and then you could add the hundredths	0
Compared to that the right side is 110 minus five times	0
I didn t see you do that	0
Evelyn thank you	0
I noticed you were drawing boxes	0
Okay	0
Youve dropped your pen	0
And lets do it really quickly	0
Okay this is a real dilemma	0
Yes	0
Hey you are going to need to use exponents to solve this next one	0
Oh yeah	0
You will find out that after the subtraction is here negative times negative is positive it becomes four Y is equal to eight	0
So figure out what the ordered pairs should be and then graph them	0
Do not help them yet	0
Get that  shot of vodka	0
Three twelfths	0
I already did the priming composite number slides because I knew what they were	0
Four because if you count four three times it would be 12	0
Mhm yes	0
Mathematically A to the zero power	0
Triangle like these are  okay	0
Yes no no	0
And Im going to tell you sit back and relax	0
Good one Landon	0
Explain your thinking	0
T	0
skip that	0
Its all like user operators  today learning and theyre going to be laughing at us CU you today	0
So its the process	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
Ninth grade	0
Write them exactly as I did if you need to	0
No worries just work with me	0
So think about what you need to do to find out how many you can buy and find the answer	0
And then 067	0
The first number if youre starting at zero zero	0
Batches pasta and tuna	0
On to the math message	0
This is what I already did for you by the way	0
So you think we need to sample some more	0
Theyre both for you	0
I actually want you to try it both ways today	0
Uh hmm	0
Alright three two one zero	0
I think you have to select the little the little hand	0
So the rise over here the rise is going to be equal to one	0
All right	0
So then the next one says fourthirds	0
Shes right with what were going to do but I want to know why	0
But actually James Im really glad you said that	0
Number one I will be able to find the rate of change or slope in a table or in a graph or between two points	0
Write just an expression	0
Are you serious	0
In the end you are going to compare answers to your questions on Math Journal page 174 and be able to explain both of these	0
Because this is equivalent to1 28 is equivalent to 1 14 and youre going to divide it up into pieces that are the size of an eighth	0
But I want to change 210 to something else	0
Listen  917	0
If you wrote this down and you are good to go with prime and composite	0
Im getting my brain all confused	0
No coats	0
Or no lets let me erase that	0
Okay	0
So	0
Okay	0
All right	0
Okay	0
I want you to know that	0
Okay	0
Lisa get your spiral out	0
Number six	0
Alright were on our way	0
We got 10 because we got the multiplication back when we did  First we did in thirds and then we get 510	0
No she didnt	0
Four	0
And the other one ran three fourths of a mile	0
All right then the next section you had to graph them which they simply put a meant to put a dot on the number line	0
So I would go 14 like this so now I have fourths	0
Negative Y squared	0
Do you think this might be a good	0
You add two thirds to make it eight thirds	0
All right lets do some highlighting and some labeling	0
Were going to use these to start estimating and making predictions about percents and start talking about percents	0
Okay lets lets get a piece of paper and write down what  youre saying and see if you all agree	0
Okay	0
Okay thanks	0
Yes it is	0
Okay	0
If we said generalize it and this goes to Alec your question that would be written as this    0 pi	0
That means like it was said just now its not just the fifteenth day	0
Now we need to put  on this	0
Lets try it because its a good idea	0
I want to show you a different way	0
If Im not seeing yours I assume that youre struggling	0
I have some things out of order	0
Correct	0
Bravo	0
Goes right there	0
Awesome job	0
Give your two by two partner high five	0
Yes because	0
Yeah because each piece is going to be	0
What	0
Your warmup  yes please	0
We have 10 plus three times six minus 16 plus one	0
You must draw fraction circles	0
It is an identity	0
All right	0
Six is right there slope is right there	0
If you both got it right great	0
And you look at y to here and you write your number thats 10 minus you find y one	0
Yes	0
Thank you	0
How much money does he have left	0
Yes	0
And one	0
There are a lot of good ideas  in what you are saying	0
What we talked about today was the answer from inequality equations that is	0
Oh it is fine right	0
But it is allowed youll still work through it	0
Its only one cent per text message but theres a point at which thats a better deal or not a better deal	0
And this cannot continue	0
Then Im going to write my number 56	0
You dont even know if youre right or wrong yet	0
Now a mixed number is exactly what it sounds like	0
You can see theres a lot of grids and you can also see theres a lot of circles	0
Knowing seven eighths is bigger than four fifths is greater than three fourths is greater than three fifths	0
83 sorry	0
All of that was at the beginning of the unit we ended the unit with the hardest type of problem	0
So but if he had 7 cups of cream then this would have to be 14	0
So it doesnt feel so crazy	0
I cant find the journal	0
Exactly so uh	0
And four shares would be two times four which is eight	0
Thank you very much	0
Is that actually true	0
410 is the last lesson on the Home Link	0
Here	0
I am	0
And on the one hand Im going to give you is this you should say m equals okay	0
Yes perfect	0
So when you do eight youre going to do one of them here and then youre going to choose another one to do on here	0
Yes come grab your stuff	0
First of all  if youre A	0
Three two one	0
So lets see if you can figure out the rest of them now that Carrie gave you a hint	0
And then you can write the equations with brackets	0
Youll write it down and calculate it	0
Positive	0
Another one another one another one another one	0
Zero hats for 5	0
And you can see all of the questions and you can see which ones you missed	0
Because I dont think everybody heard Charlotte	0
And I really want you to think about why this is working	0
So you would take this	0
Because 15 is the closest number I could get with the 5	0
So theyre going to need to redo to follow their rule	0
Okay	0
Illtalk to you soon	0
Ive already done two people and so I could make a tally up here if I wanted to how many people Ive done Ive got two people so far	0
So we already did the first so youre going to start with problem number three	0
Five four three	0
Lets show how we would do this using pictures	0
If we were in class that I could look at those	0
Its right there	0
X comes before Y in the alphabet	0
You need to redo three plus three isnt correct	0
Okay seven eighths is greater than four fifths and now its for somebody thats bigger is greater than three fourths is greater than three fifths	0
When we look at our problem thats not going to work	0
You can hand to it or just put it on the counter	0
Give me your fist to five	0
Im just saying that that	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Okay so I got that right	0
Keep up the good work everybody	0
So slope is rise over run	0
It was um it was um  twice the size of that  Then	0
Hum let me try to make one and see if you can do it right away	0
And for here they will do the same thing	0
Its two to the fifteenth power	0
And Michael youre going to join Harmony and Alyssa	0
Very good	0
This is our warmup	0
Yeah okay	0
Okay now Im going to put our learning intention underneath	0
I know you guys are like in on the algorithm right now but we still have to work on those area models	0
Yes sir	0
Give me five or high five	0
We cant say it	0
The issue then let s see if we can state what the issues are	0
You do remember	0
Okay excellent	0
Do you want my pencil	0
Oh wait	0
It has to be a yes	0
I dont know if I did it correctly	0
All right	0
This ones easy	0
Alright	0
I have a feeling its the exact same thing	0
But now the tricky one comes in	0
Thats what I was going after	0
Okay	0
Hold on lets wrap up our conversations in three two one zero	0
Again were going equation graph table table graph equation just really those are our three points of the triangle that were working on	0
So the only option we have is were checking to see the side side angle side	0
And I looked at I looked at what he  built here to represent some of the  story and I thought by looking at this model that I couldnt  really tell of the boy and the girl who was taller by looking at  them I wasnt really sure and I didnt know really if Mark  cared about that	0
Brian shows his paper You made six	0
minus because its taking away	0
So you can just put hands	0
Alex made a poster with 100 paper clips for the 100Day school celebration	0
Oh no	0
Page 201	0
And then you could go Well maybe I could go to 110	0
So lets start with something simple	0
Pick it I dont care	0
Uh yes I think so	0
Okay	0
Is it onethird	0
Dont forget the arrowheads they indicate the direction	0
And thats exactly right	0
I dont remember exactly what theyre called because	0
Jake is designing a picture for a cover of his reading folder	0
But the important thing is that you keep moving forward because you guys do know a lot about math	0
They both have x and y they both add up to 180	0
So what s wrong if I  say to you	0
You are going to sit down all you need to do is wait for your three	0
We can use division	0
Okay so a sage and scribe format would be Im in a group with lets say Duncan and Im going to say okay Duncan I want you to write 084 times four and Duncan on his whiteboard would write zero oop I just used the wrong one just uno momento por favor got to get that off my whiteboard or I will ruin it	0
Its going to be a quick think time 10 seconds	0
Were going to make it a little bit harder	0
Okay	0
Wonderful	0
All right	0
Okay talk to your neighbor and come up with another one	0
Okay	0
Im going to have Miss Elyse walk us through this one because Im interested to see where she took hers based on what I preliminarily saw on your paper	0
Yeah	0
I think sometimes you just look	0
So were gonna have a really good day in here	0
Lucka is done so she can check her work	0
I see some people using the multiplication strategy	0
Alright	0
So now my first step is to break those teams apart	0
Yeah	0
Now once a week I think it is on Tuesdays but once a week you guys get a flyer that is sent out to your houses	0
What do I do next	0
Okay	0
So Im going to multiply 38 times something	0
Because its equal part so	0
Youre taking part of that original fraction	0
You just have to think about instead of 15 I have 35	0
Theres a faster way to do it for long division	0
Just a second	0
What Im going to ask you to do over and over again in this unit is take pictures of your proofs and email them to me so that I can use your work up here on the board to give you guys an idea of all of the different thinking ways of doing this	0
For 16 you multiply 1 by 5	0
Okay	0
Look at your fraction circles	0
Ladies Im going to have you do me a favor	0
And Im going to go into E tools	0
Then I told the kids when they came back in the room that they had 30 seconds to find as many little squares as they could	0
Yes	0
Please ask any questions that you have on these homework problems	0
Minus four T times minus two if you dont look at this	0
I feel like were doing a pretty good job with it	0
I could add zeros all day over here and its not going to matter	0
So just after 16 it would cross that zero line	0
Youre going to click sign up	0
Wai	0
Yeah	0
Oh yes	0
45	0
Youre going to plot coordinate points	0
So 06 is our y intercept	0
This is different for us	0
Put your name on that paper because you are turning it in	0
Circle the exes that represent chimpanzees that are 60 and half inches tall	0
Hey two thats that line	0
So it really is going down by five every time	0
Therefore it is an obtuse angle	0
Okay	0
So in order to get started were going to do a little activity	0
Some of them were laminated but theyre not all	0
Im the boss	0
Its good	0
Just the base	0
There you go	0
This plus seven only means the y intercept	0
I know that youre not paying attention and youre not in the pear deck	0
Okay	0
So Terrances is more orangy	0
There you go	0
I just want us to understand the strategy	0
I want to write down	0
Okay	0
All right come back	0
Nice job both of you	0
See you tomorrow	0
Why	0
He draws the picture of a book on a coordinate grid	0
Most easiest thing ever	0
Share your idea what do you think is going to happen	0
Whos had pita bread before	0
78 and 56 would that be seven what was my other number	0
Zoey Im seeing your face	0
You say okay six is my rise two is my run	0
So lets label some things that we know using our notation that weve learned	0
Before you do anything  let me see	0
Now show me using pieces how you can find a common denominator	0
Im going to write a sentence	0
We are going to continue working on this as we learn more and more and more	0
That you will see three problems on the board I just want you to answer the first one	0
So right now because they have different minutes and they have different miles thats really tricky to do	0
Our first part says I can use a tape diagram and this is similar to its kind of like a number line	0
Or you could substitute N for 12 and put quotations around	0
Do we type our answers in the gap	0
So Mr Dale is going to be selling milk at his convenience store	0
No yeah 180	0
No that is not the starting number	0
So four bottles for 3	0
Can somebody pick up that water bottle	0
I gave you that because it was funny	0
Poor Michelle its okay	0
Okay then lets make it 19	0
Yes	0
Now if were going to fill out the table which I think it might be helpful to fill out the table first	0
Your name and number goes on the top first	0
Eric says we need the same denominator	0
Please John please work	0
SO we want to get this up pretty high	0
I put my zero and then I put my three and my two for 320	0
I gueStudents I better put the lights back on	0
Sixteen	0
It doesnt equal one whole	0
Okay friends Im sorry	0
Put it here	0
Sure you can but why not use your journal	0
So now youre going to take it as division	0
Yeah	0
Plus the other rightangled side squared the surface area of the other square that you attached to it	0
I would like you to put your first and your last name on the paper todays date and then I would like you to solve the first five problems only	0
I know its okay	0
Okay	0
So two ways that you can write it	0
This is where it intercepts it	0
Four goes into eight two times not four times	0
All right	0
If it was here it would be 96 and if it was here it would be less than one	0
Let s line   em up	0
Thats the special thing about it	0
I would like you working with your shoulder partners	0
So as Noah pointed out there a hundred squares	0
And this two for 3	0
Okay	0
Mathew Lionel and Audrey come talk to me up here	0
Now if I read this I read zero and eight hundredths	0
Those are R to R prime prime	0
I dont know	0
So make sure that youre feeling good about four dash one four dash two patterns and linear functions	0
Lets just have a look at those three numbers again a mean of thirty point five seven a median of twentyeight point five and a mode of 25	0
I am moving on	0
Yes	0
So lets try that one again	0
Yes so that works	0
Oh explain your picture	0
If I had my fraction circle it would be easier	0
That is our learning intention	0
All right	0
All right	0
Youre okay	0
Mmhmm Go to the next box	0
And then you take the surface areas of the triangles you subtract that	0
If you multiply your numerator It does match	0
Well those zero and two I think it wants you to do the between one and two	0
I did too	0
Okay	0
So John is also trying to say that the bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces	0
Please give exact answers	0
I know	0
You will be known all over the whole world right that this is your math notebook	0
So now please read uh page 164 to page 164	0
So she doubled the first one and left the second one alone so it should have been	0
This one	0
So we go Step 1 you do this	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
I think	0
So you did like that and then counted	0
You can write down the equation of the problem and you can write down the answer	0
Thats the image	0
Especially as we get into denominators of like a hundred and a thousand	0
All right	0
Get them up there	0
For those of you who are already good at your multiplication facts its going to be super Emmerson I promise	0
So lines line segments and rays	0
Okay thank you	0
Eight says the equation C 5N represents the cost in dollars for N caps	0
Length times width	0
Okay	0
Okay go to zero please	0
is yes although its kind of a clear overone uptwo overone uptwo overone uptwo	0
Ill give you a hint you should draw a key just like I did	0
You couldve made your life a little bit easier by isolating the radical add this x over to this side	0
This class is just inspiring	0
Youre sharp	0
They must be on the proper side of the wall	0
369121518 2124 27	0
may I ask you a question	0
but I think we can make it better	0
Im understanding now	0
Now let s do it this way	0
Okay	0
Look at the faces of it theyre all rectangles and they all connect to the two faces	0
We agreed	0
Then I want you to complete number seven one three five seven	0
Theyd all be open then theyd all be closed and theyd all be open then theyll all be closed theyd all be open and theyd all be closed	0
That is interesting	0
First you multiply the two numerators and then the two denominators and then you use the products to make them into a fraction	0
First one I gave you the X and asked you for the Y	0
4 x 6	0
30 seconds think time and go	0
Ok so you said to me that nine divided by one third right  when you measured it out you found out that that was  twentyseven and some of you did it differently	0
We have five minutes to get the rest of our work done whatever it is were working on and then were going to transition	0
I think we do	0
Okay	0
Ok	0
Try your model	0
No	0
No Im glad you never left	0
Oh I see	0
Thank you thank you	0
And 30 is nice because we know three times five is 15 so 30 times five would be 150 and one times 30 is 30	0
The  two in that one there is a three and theres two  ones on the outside	0
just rewrite them	0
I I got one and onethird	0
Okay	0
Erase that drawing	0
Last one	0
Write reasonable ones	0
Okay	0
Its sort of like doubling it but Im going to add it to itself	0
Okay	0
In order to get from 5 to 15 I multiplied by 3 so to have an equivalent fraction Im going to multiply 2 times 3 and get 6	0
Now I want you to tell me using a reasonable estimate which one it is	0
So now were doing this multiplying	0
Okay	0
Right here	0
Now what I want to ask you is this	0
When I did 285 I said five goes into 28 five times and then theres three pieces that are the size of 15 left over	0
Three two one and show	0
Some of them have peloton	0
Just to remind you that what you have to do is total up to start with	0
Yes	0
Its 6 times 1 is six and you add a zero	0
Now the person is going to workout on the elliptical so theyre going to burn 10 calories per minute more to get our total	0
Try it out 130 number one	0
Youre 100 right	0
And this line this one equals nine	0
And Jamie said there would be the same	0
Good	0
Okay	0
Yes thats going fine thats going fine	0
Zachary and Dakota can be talking about which one of their answers is right or if theyre both right or and Wade and Charlie can be talking about which one of their answers is right or if theyre both right	0
Look down at your paper right now	0
Okay so notice just really want you to notice if the x values go to two different y values then thats not a function	0
Oh my goodness	0
Yeah yeah yeah	0
So the first thing Im going to look at is they said that their rule was going to be Im going to triple the Y coordinate double the X coordinate	0
Just the total cost would be the texts times three cents	0
Keep going	0
This one says A recipe for chicken marinade which is like a juice that you might soak chicken in	0
Oh my gosh I called you by your brothers name	0
Keep going	0
And then we have an equation here with greater than less than ordering the fractions and showing why seven eighths is biggest because its closest to one	0
Okay	0
This one was not nice	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
I want you to think about how this is different than what we have done	0
Weve heard from  Michael and weve heard from Erik	0
Okay	0
We have 23 and 9	0
And then you just do like one step like oh not so bad	0
Now would be a good time so you dont miss the teaching part of the lesson	0
You just cant	0
All right weve got about three more minutes so that you have something that you can talk about with me about this data	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Thats why I drew that blue box of rate of noxious blue box	0
Oh wait nevermind	0
Please come up here and tell me first of all what Oh there it is its over here	0
Can you show the fractions for me	0
Good job	0
Just wait because well work on it later	0
I want you to label your diagram the same way weve been labeling and then partner A is going to talk about labeling	0
So	0
Well lets use my finger	0
Nope thats to the right	0
Yeah	0
Do you have an extra one	0
Its going to divide	0
Great	0
Three times three	0
Yes	0
Well I think her spaces are here Erik	0
Five	0
Yeah	0
So now the Xcoordinates that are not zero are twice as far to the right because we multiplied them by two	0
Why is this not working	0
I dont want mark	0
We have We have one unit one unit pan of brownies	0
Thats the key thing	0
Right	0
Yeah	0
Heres how you find the midpoint	0
Hm	0
We are dividing parts into sections	0
Our division symbol can look a variety of different ways	0
Okay thank you	0
So if our first coordinate is five one I know that I need to come over and find five and then that takes care of that but then I know I need to take it up to one which is right there	0
Those are the two most common answers that I saw	0
Then full turn	0
Okay lets see	0
What are you doing putti marks	0
request letters of recommendation	0
This is a nifty idea and you could use it but it does something different	0
I know what youre trying to say youre just not saying it the way I would like it to be expressed	0
Times ten times ten times five	0
So 50 thats 50 plus two 52 and half of that is 26	0
Thats awesome	0
Okay	0
Given you guys the answer	0
Yes	0
In the beginning	0
You re telling me its 33  centimeters	0
Its going to be joining Google Classroom make a Khan Academy account if you need to and then work on the Google Classroom assignment	0
So if we have this area model of a sandwich and were just going to say this is his 56 of a sandwich	0
4x3	0
I think thats why theyre a big warmup	0
This ones three away	0
Whoa you ate a lot of pizza miss	0
It just doesnt like it	0
Thank you	0
All right so Im going to split it by 13 this direction and then Im going to go 15  straight lines I would be a two	0
Dont try put it up here	0
Hm	0
I see three of you that have your masks below your nose	0
Hold the end	0
First question	0
What is S S S	0
But you need to get work done	0
Do we always have to write the remainder as a fraction	0
Because you said that theyre three people and they had to buy three train tickets	0
five divided by five is one that to multiply five times one equals five step three subtract equals zero step four bring down we have nothing more to bring down	0
Heres the equation they came up with in parentheses	0
Thats why you have a straight edge use the straight edge	0
Okay so so the words in yellow estimate to estimate means to make an educated guess	0
Hey boys and girls I still need to grade a whole bunch of your math boxes I want to do those today	0
Theyre equal theyre congruent	0
Its okay with this right	0
Come on	0
Yes	0
There you go there you go there you go and Mariah I forgot to give you yours	0
And then lets see Ill do green actually	0
No	0
Hey	0
That	0
You can also look at the sentence starters on the wall	0
We have proof of it right here in our addition because we know how to add fractions	0
Double the first number of the original pair and inaudible	0
One of the best in the class no doubt about it	0
One hundred forty	0
But thats training	0
Then everybody on Ashers team will show the board	0
Okay so thats our goal for today	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Okay so 123456789	0
Like in word form or just printed out	0
Well I think	0
We started off with doing the problem	0
In fact I would be more than happy to trade any of you four dollars for 40	0
All right Im just going to give you a couple of problems to practice and what youre going to do is youre going to solve them independently and then youre going to compare with your partners so everyone try and hide StSamantha you need to go get a piece of paper and a pencil please youre going to be with your partners and youre going to do it yourself then trade off	0
Right now find a partner to share with	0
I would like you all to try the last one on your own	0
Nice	0
Thats a factor some of you are holding up a two thats a factor	0
Here	0
That would be 3500	0
We thought about the division and the multiplication and they just put it in an inbox	0
Well at the moment I have different choices of an ending	0
You can make diagrams on the pizzas on the first page	0
Excellent	0
So this is plus three	0
It becomes this situation	0
Thats beautiful	0
MiStudents  are we Do we need paper	0
Tomorrow	0
Okay there we go	0
You guys are actually going to be representing mathematical problems on a coordinate grid which is nothing new from yesterday except that there is going to be another level of complexity added to it	0
So think about your answer for just a minute	0
Okay	0
You can do with it really what you want	0
So then you could just know that hey seven goes into 639 times	0
Common denominator	0
Does that make sense Diego	0
Quickly quickly walk about the room	0
If you were talking about I see what your saying	0
And Yes it got taller and yes it also got wider	0
Youre going to stay right here	0
Yeah	0
Good good	0
Okay	0
And so Im going to choose three fourths first	0
This is printed in full	0
I got 13rd too	0
We should see the same thing on her side	0
Yes	0
At the bottom of the handout	0
Stay here for just a second	0
You are correct with that	0
No you were not confused	0
What makes it great	0
Right	0
Voices off in three two one and zero	0
I think theres another one	0
I hope you notice Mrs Phillips that  theyre adding fractions	0
Heres 16 and two and that one is 10 and two so heres 10 and two	0
Okay	0
Class everyone say it multiplicative identity property	0
Okay the next one your homework tonight you have to use paper so youre probably each going to need If you will show me one as a drawing so this is it	0
We dont stop here	0
It did not ask how much did you save	0
Hmph	0
A 3 in the 10th place	0
I love your feedback by the way	0
Ill get more from Paul	0
So an estimate is a close guess to the accurate number based on thought	0
Okay so 2x equals four times 19	0
If somebody uses a cabin a further additional fee has to be paid	0
Yes	0
Well all behind schedule so we are going to speed up a little bit on it	0
Okay question	0
Okay so we should circle No	0
Please think about it	0
Lets do a nice golf clap for Lance	0
An integer how many of you are like Thats a new word I havent heard before	0
No	0
Okay but I would not expect you to draw that	0
Then Ill have one whole	0
You just broke those boxes in half	0
And three to five	0
Think about a pizza	0
But then and he didnt want to go over the limit so he just wrote 8	0
Okay	0
Nice job	0
If I ate 10 of a bag of MMs where there were 80 of them	0
Okay so right here I have two pieces that are cut into fourths	0
Doesn t work	0
Guys you did everything beautifully here	0
Im done	0
Yeah	0
I don t I still don t think so well because well well see like I said  before when you split the ahh when you split the thirds in half and  they make sixths it s still like	0
Ok but he and Jessica had also built a model right that  was rather interesting for one of the problems that they  were sharing with Brian and Michael	0
So in todays lesson you are going to be able to multiply a decimal number and a whole number using strategies based on place value and properties of operation	0
Keep going a little bit more	0
Times the whole number	0
So I have to actually move my number to the 1000s place value	0
And fractions greater than one by composing composing you know composers write music they create things and breaking apart holes	0
When youre thinking about different problems its fine	0
Six times nine is 54	0
We need a capital letter	0
Move your star to the right area	0
All hes telling me is that hes multiplying the X coordinate by six and in the second one the original book was 01 and in his it was 06	0
I need to do that again	0
Were going to spend a lot of time talking about those like today and tomorrow and the next day	0
So you had some problems in the beginning	0
That tells us we can just focus on the denominators	0
Keep doing your homework	0
bigger	0
So we would write diagonals diagonals bisect angles okay	0
And then this could represent one teaspoon	0
For every  one of the rods okay because I d like you to record your  results and be able to convince us that that works	0
Okay so Stacey and Reuban get rid of one of those fives	0
The way to think of it is dont get freaked out by fractions	0
Okay You are listening	0
Were going backwards the opposite	0
18 plus	0
What where they make these chocolate chip cookies	0
Everybody needs to show this	0
Then when we do our LCM we can either say 25 x 4 or 4 x 25 which either way would be 100 would be the same thing	0
You are absolutely correct	0
I was asking you because I cant remember	0
And those are big goals	0
Okay	0
Ive got to do it the other way	0
But using using the information that we gathered from that little thing	0
But when its not going to work	0
I already have	0
Yeah	0
We got that greatest pizza was the eight students that had the seven pizzas	0
The treadmill display  We have them right here	0
Nice job explaining	0
Yeah	0
All right	0
First I did 6 x 6	0
And that is written above here	0
How many fifths Okay Im gonna stop there	0
Youre right	0
Maybe you should go and buy some smart paper	0
So there you go Avery	0
I love the hand signals	0
Okay	0
So we should be able to go one fourth two fourths Youll have to write small	0
And here is what I would like for you to do	0
Okay your slope is one quarter	0
In my experience of looking at these two charts the first one where you add up the range the standard deviation didnt change but the range	0
Once you ve solved that you and your partner are then going to compare your answers talk about it	0
diagonals diagonals bisect	0
Right	0
Because the line the vertical line goes through more goes through lets say this goes through five points at the same time	0
But something has to be happening over here	0
There are many of them but within these since the fact is were making the quadrilateral into a triangle	0
Yup yup	0
Fourfifths fivesixths and sixeighths	0
Okay	0
Youre going to have a chance to talk and youre going to have a chance to explain how you get your answer	0
Im going to be driving a lot	0
Okay	0
Because thats how I label them	0
One	0
So we want that amount but we have to have a numerator of one	0
They divided each pizza into four pieces	0
Youre at 30 seconds	0
Okay thank you	0
Now were at 13 and then another 7 would give you 20	0
Theres the piece	0
Okay	0
If you recall you had a homework assignment in which a grandchild was taken to a theme park and every	0
Yeah	0
She has to do it consistently	0
Hold on I have an Eagle Buck for you	0
Write it out show me what you did	0
Mmm yes and no I dont see any decimals on this one and this one is not in the right place	0
Ms Reeves may I use the restroom	0
Hold it	0
My shirt doesnt have a magnet in it	0
When I did 49 seven times seven I had to change place values with that nine	0
When the government comes to take you away youll know why	0
I thought I was helping you out	0
I think the eights are purple	0
You started with partial products I think maybe	0
Thats not even	0
Here are some of the common mistakes but instead of having pictures of very awesome 6th graders I have pictures of some animals in their Halloween costumes that I will unveil in just a minute	0
You have the area of 450 square feet	0
Strings are 2 each and come in sets of four	0
Okay	0
Brackets	0
Can I get one Ms Levy in training to pass these out and one Ms Levy in training to pass these out please	0
Okay	0
And this is going to be 65	0
It goes fast	0
Picture and equation	0
That is the basis of todays lesson	0
I think I counted seven	0
combine like terms so it nine w plus 8	0
You guys I would like you just do the three digit by two digit to start	0
Jessica had a correct answer but hers looked nothing like Tessas who had a correct answer	0
We said 8 at first	0
Let me work on that explaining	0
Okay	0
Okay all right	0
Yeah	0
It was just the tip of his hair	0
Schedule for the week	0
I dont know	0
If you chose 5 x 40 great you got 200 youre going to be done even faster	0
Actually it is	0
Sides	0
Mmhmm	0
So for the very first one this section right here that is equal to 140 tickets	0
Theres a lot of steps	0
Lets try another one	0
When I look at this I see an addition problem first	0
Mr G can I start	0
One two three	0
Because some of them are not right	0
There you go	0
So lets fill in the mapping diagram this one is especially important to use the text tool for so think about your domain from from the last problems you got 01234	0
Yes	0
He can make six whole pizzas	0
Oh my gosh the picture even shows me that	0
Yeah	0
Quarter turn	0
Lookie here 30 x 8 is 240	0
What does number one say	0
Can you explain why	0
Okay students time is up	0
Cant you just say 4	0
Hm	0
No not necessarily when youre looking for something	0
So all were doing is multiplying our numerator and our denominator by a number	0
T R A P This is six comma negative three	0
So like here it only crosses right there	0
Over here is I mean behind them here is an F here and there	0
So anytime the numerator is one it is a unit fraction	0
Alright lets go back to this	0
Do we have a minute to do another one or do we have to clean  up	0
And for exponents we have to remember back from what I first introduced to you in fifth grade	0
Were going to practice some more though	0
Okay were gonna do two more	0
It was that the excuse problem	0
We each got four slices	0
Because P equals 10	0
Yes you just double click it	0
It should be over three down five	0
Well would it be like	0
I don t have my gym clothes and I m going to get a zero for not being I m unprepared	0
I want to know how you think about it so	0
Yeah	0
This is one of the tricks I taught you	0
Im not standing but Im	0
Multiply the whole number with the denominator then add a numerator and get a new numerator with the same denominator	0
These two had some right answers but some wrong answers	0
Its the inscribed angle	0
Melissa its not asking for a picture	0
Nice	0
And then for E over four down three	0
They dont get it	0
T	0
And now because I want to say he put one in I ll uh that as 1  he put one in	0
Thats why I was able to do other things before we did math	0
So just know that	0
Okay	0
I I	0
List the first 10 square numbers and describe any patterns that you see	0
We are going to go and we are going to complete one division problem	0
So there are several pages here for you to work on	0
My budding mathematicians here	0
Should I try that	0
Oh uh for Dalton in a moment	0
So quiz on Wednesday	0
Youre going to graph on that	0
So maybe something like this	0
AP forms when you hand them to me they should have your part filled out	0
Thank you	0
I do not think the height of the trapezoid will change because Amys rule does not change the Y coordinate	0
I had a lot of paper and then I put it down	0
This is taken from everyday math	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
It should be labeled	0
Okay	0
This whole table is going to do that one	0
When you are asked to use tools the tools help you figure things out	0
All right	0
No	0
This way	0
Were going to work on it in class today and in class tomorrow and what were about to work on is not your homework	0
So I want you to notice the connection between these equations	0
I dont understand why this is being so awful right now	0
Yes	0
So I said that My prediction was correct because the X coordinate was and the Y coordinate was 15 and that means that it was taller and wider	0
Two times four is two three times two is six	0
For now	0
Go ahead	0
But notice those points so you have one comma three and Ill move my cursor over this	0
So Im gonna write not similar different angles	0
Does everybody know their number at their table group	0
Then thered be 23 of 34	0
Talk to your table about it if youre like Im not sure I think this fraction might work	0
I cant believe James doesnt remember	0
I didnt think so	0
Is it	0
Okay Im going to pause for a second	0
Maybe you can build that  one on the overhead when were finished	0
Okay and then your slope when you put those together should be 13	0
So talk	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
And then I knew that two times three was six and	0
This is really easy	0
Oh you can turn and talk to them	0
Wheres your math journal	0
Ok well lets even out the ends	0
I wonder what that is	0
Um ok its doubled because it now it has four oranges and  two purples or a brown so	0
Yeah	0
This is what youll be working here when you do your open response	0
I have a friend up here that needs Ella you cant just stand	0
21	0
Oh so Im not sure why we have a disconnect here	0
one and nine fourths	0
So now lets change the mental picture from this to this	0
but Im just going to quickly read this out to you	0
Okay	0
One in itself	0
Try to think about what I have to write	0
Now even if youre not sure exactly how to do it I want you to have an estimate ready to go	0
Well your brain just grew	0
Okay then	0
I need one more because everyone needs three pieces	0
Because we travel too much	0
Weve looked everywhere	0
Awesome	0
Then two teams fundraising goal is 720	0
This is what it looks like	0
Okay and there are also diagrams	0
Im going to ask you to apply one strategy to problems two and four on page 170	0
So we have two different arguments at the table and it s  very important that you listen so you understand what the arguments  are	0
Its due tonight its worth eight points	0
You certainly have a place to start	0
So you are all going to go to this right now go to that thing	0
Im not sure why this is locked	0
And everything you want to know about spheres	0
It seems like more people didnt finish than did finish	0
for being so quick	0
Yeah	0
All right people	0
That means that youre probably going to Youre going to connect the dots as you plot them and youre going to come back to 51	0
It will be easier	0
Okay  very good	0
I want you to understand this at entrylevel	0
combine like terms y four y and well subtract nine as well	0
Then you could see how many 112 plus how many 112	0
Its tricky though all right	0
Were going to just tweak this and instead of three its going to be two  because we start off with 10	0
Lets see what Im talking about	0
A couple of years ago me my mom and my dad went to see	0
No	0
No it is not	0
It s part of the theme that is weird	0
Oh weve got some modest folks here	0
Mmhmm	0
Let me write this  down	0
So give me a fraction you would like to work with	0
Yes	0
Okay you are done with math assignments that you have to turn in	0
Okay	0
are for Jenny	0
Shh	0
So we know how to divide it	0
Okay so we divide both of these by three	0
Last one	0
All right	0
What kind of pizza Nolan	0
Okay and then Mr Haley Im gonna move you to breakout room nine	0
The xaxis were going to travel one and then were going to go up two on the yaxis	0
My stuff is creaky	0
Okay before we move onto the next page	0
We have seven dots here	0
And Id like you to write  to me about about that	0
Hi	0
so whatever these angles are it doesnt matter	0
But you need to buy 10	0
Two common denominators for each be seated when you are done	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Thats funny because Ive already talked about it	0
Im not going to lay on this dirty floor and be horizontal	0
Yes Im a math Mr Strathom	0
Where is this supposed to be	0
I want to go back to what you said that the bigger the number the smaller the pieces	0
Yeah	0
Kind of	0
Because we dont have a number there	0
I will write problems on the board	0
But if we were  trying to solve this problem this is really the equation that we would be looking for	0
Now if you disagree you have to say why you disagree  because they are saying that one third is smaller than a half one half  is bigger than a third it s one third bigger than a third that s what  they are saying	0
Today we have a reason why they are the same triangle	0
These are the tick marks	0
Ok that s interesting	0
Its right in between six and seven	0
Yeah so were going to divide 24 by 10	0
One you can see because you have to be able to determine the difference	0
So when you get your answer you have to think about it because Ive heard multiple people got 32	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
WaitTmessed up and youll see why	0
Its not an online game	0
Seven	0
And when I add wine up my decimals and my place value numbers I am able to add my numbers together to get 237 600000ths	0
I dont think it could be in the	0
Theyre super super super super super small	0
One two three four five six seven	0
Nice work	0
Ramona that looks perfect	0
Do to the bottom we must do to the bottom	0
Four times four equals 16	0
Completely random irrelAbbynt wasting your time with these math problems	0
I see 48	0
Yes	0
Id like to hear from  some people that have not been up yet so Id like some volunteers	0
We dont have much time so well Im sorry but okay then	0
Oh thats too big	0
miss Strathom	0
There we go	0
Theyve got to think about that	0
You re saying a half is bigger than a third because  the green is a half and the you called it the pink is a third  and it s a red bigger	0
We want to figure out what that line actually is	0
Heres student Cs work	0
Always just think of my first step before you think about how complicated it is	0
This was really hard to really picture this in your brain	0
Lets see here what is next on our agenda	0
Go ahead	0
If it is an equation it may be one solution only	0
So you always have to remember when it says Mary and her two friends	0
Okay	0
But then different	0
Youre not allowed to say that Brianna	0
Just pull it down a little bit	0
So its giving me an example I dont want to use so I would like you all to turn into your journal pages	0
Except I placed it on its side	0
ameesha got one here sister one got one sister two got one	0
Okay	0
Zero was 12	0
That s just another name for it	0
In order to subitize you have to look at a group of dots and you have to use what you know about arrays and multiplication in order to tell me how many dots there are	0
So closest to 85	0
Okay	0
Im going to make a copy of this math message	0
Okay	0
So miss the person thats giving the instructions	0
There were a couple of students in the second period who they were like Oh my gosh I love this	0
Reese	0
Thats right	0
I need to see it on everyones whiteboards	0
I want you to take 30 seconds think about it	0
already	0
Okay we do not have 153 over here Hudson	0
Andrea	0
Im glad youre here sweetie	0
If  you could stop what you re doing for a moment I know it s hard  and sort of listen to my questions	0
Like a quotation mark	0
Thats good	0
That would make more sense	0
Mmm	0
So we will go Adam who was in your group buddy	0
One sixth	0
I said dont take your coloring book out right now I want you to listen	0
Oh so slow	0
The angles equal 90	0
Yes	0
Full explanation	0
Were working on it	0
I will get you up there as often as possible	0
Were going to go to your em four site	0
So C is right	0
Nope	0
Perfect	0
Um in front it says three S	0
Go gets your whiteboards and dry erase markers	0
Not everybody does that	0
Harry just proved Im right so I didnt make a mistake after all	0
Okay my slant length  this one has the longest slant length	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Okay so today	0
Okay so thats called the origin	0
So I am going to instructor paste this and I will ask random people to share their response	0
And then number three make sure you have no missing assignments	0
Okay	0
Yes youre right	0
Give me a thumbs up when youre done gluing	0
Thank you and thats what we do in math	0
Im old	0
Yeah	0
You can talk to your neighbor about some of the fractions you think might work	0
Do we do this the rest of this	0
Right	0
Ok	0
I should lets go with that	0
You dont know	0
All right	0
Unless you guys talk about it you might become lost and confused	0
Hey guys make sure you have 19 numbers in your list	0
Get ready for your presentations tomorrow	0
Everybody heard that	0
Two	0
Oh thank you darling	0
Okay	0
I  think he knows what Im looking for	0
You try to use what you have learned in equations to find the value for X	0
Or Im taking 365 and Im adding it this many times	0
Okay	0
Weve only got a couple more to do on this section	0
You may express different expressions in expanded form or factorized form	0
Did you guys know that Mr Adams is like	0
You can write this as 2 tenths and 9 hundredths but we will get into it some more	0
So you need to think about what the biggest fraction is	0
So were going to try this out	0
Or you can just do that	0
We have seen ladies and gentlemen we are going to continue	0
If you know the answer to it just raise your hand	0
Yes youre doing it in your so I think you have to be more independent	0
I can interpret coordinate values in context	0
The run between the points they dont go side by side so zero	0
So were going to figure out how to do this	0
Are you interested in game theory	0
Bonnie	0
Look at how we did it	0
If you look on the front and see that at zero months the meerkats are three inches tall youre going to find zero months three inches tall and a plot point there	0
Yes	0
Lovely we have the basics of fractions down	0
A little less than four	0
Please try thinking about it a little methods of changing this shape without changing the area	0
But then how do you And then you times five times eight and eight times five but then what do you do after that really	0
Come get it if you want it	0
Okay	0
So the y intercept is 03	0
We said that fractions are similar	0
You re on a roll now	0
Then for Samanthas dress shes not as big	0
All right so I see most people started with the y intercept which is a great start 0707 that means our equation is going to end in a plus seven	0
Nice	0
First I do fourths	0
Yes I did sixth	0
So one chore extra 150	0
Yes	0
Or actually explain it on the blackboard in a minute	0
Yes and then you can talk about it	0
You cant do it backwards like	0
Jack we could say if there was a remainder it could be 42 people or 4 and 210ths of a person	0
The formula is four thirds pi R cubed	0
I think no youve still got people using that  please	0
One house with two people	0
So yeah you want that one which means youre going to have to change the formula as well	0
I do want you guys to check to make sure that each the widths of your bars are the same width	0
And we just made a table	0
So youve just got to select the point tool and click somewhere out there	0
Four plus five is nine then 11 seven eight nine 10 11 12 4214	0
And so youre going to get some practice problems on this obviously	0
Alright Lila just make sure you mute yourself please	0
Is there information I can ignore	0
Remember the only bad thing to be doing right now is not trying	0

Kalen said something similar Deacon said something similar	0
You want to take some really good notes today	0
Then	0
Wait what was that	0
Were getting our work done here look	0
And this was tough for people because all of the numbers disappeared	0
And then thats six centimeters	0
So long division Im going to demonstrate what it looks like but I dont expect you to understand exactly what Im doing yet because I havent taught that yet	0
Here ladies	0
I will know Im successful when I can justify a rule created to get the largest fraction in the game	0
All right	0
Well just use the paper towels that are to the side for right now	0
That goes that starts at B and then goes	0
I have 10 full bags so far six marbles per bag	0
All right	0
So I know all Im talking about is the commonalities	0
Yes like this is the same as this	0
You already did this	0
We could also do two	0
I m not positive	0
Were doing a whole class but thank you for checking	0
Hudson and Lisa please come share your work with me	0
I think that the secret is that the number in the box always goes always goes next to it	0
Because I have fifteen different squares 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15	0
and you do more with fractions youre going to have a good deep understanding of how fractions work	0
A four is like Im pretty close	0
I will tell you this is a part to part to whole relationship	0
Okay	0
Youre right yes	0
Okay so now that I have this new problem 30 times 25	0
It is worth three	0
You are welcome	0
The one that I added in for tomorrow I think youre gonna really like as well	0
Could you	0
Jack can you pick up our cards and make sure you have all 21 of them please	0
So when we took when we thought of a fifth of 15 we needed to in order for us to have a denominator of five we needed to have five groups for that 15	0
Lets go back were going to need to go back to look at this	0
Thats the equation for it	0
Okay	0
Okay so lets go back to this one	0
I cried an awful lot	0
Well now this would be one out of six	0
Yes	0
and then theres also 2 cups	0
I think I saw one of these	0
There is not a specific way that you need to choose them	0
So this is how we figured out the four weeks this is how we figures out the one week	0
Try	0
But it says estimate and write a number model to show your work solve each multi step number story	0
Y equals minus three X thats what you guys have plus four	0
Put them in order  from the outside	0
Okay	0
Ms Strathom	0
So for example for example two 5 11	0
Im going to be pulling a card	0

Guys this is what weve been doing for all of them so far	0
So if I wanted to write that ld say this	0
Two	0
No matter	0
Tracy if youre talking to us we cannot hear you	0
So when I look the first thing I have to do is to say Well I cant add those together because my denominators not there	0
Quickly	0
It would be nice to know it and also know where it comes from	0
inauidble	0
Im fine with you working with partners as you have your snacks but let me show you what youre doing at your seat	0
That wasnt the question	0
Again youre not going to get something very interesting because all of these are spread out and youre just going to get a whole bunch of little blocks	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Okay were going to need your whiteboards	0
Partially	0
Okay	0
Four minus one Well I know denominator is going to be five and four minus point is three and four minus one here is three	0
Every single person in the class can at least show me that theyre alive on the other side of the zoom and try something on this problem	0
Chilly	0
Just a minute though I have a question	0
The calculations step I would put on my calculator to get theta would be theta is equal to the inverse cosine of 58	0
Its not bad but there are three variations from the formula which we need to list	0
Like two sections tall	0
We went up one point but what was  we dont have a number	0
But usually I let you guys come fill this out	0
9 is nine tenths	0
I would like for you to agree disagree or have a question	0
Daniel Im going to let you go first because youre going to be the one that has to walk out	0
Now I picked 5 I picked these ones but if I go to 6 or 7 where some of you are stinky still with your multiplication facts you might need to do 10	0
I do it to the left side I do it to the right side and I get h is equal to 32	0
Yes	0
Yes	0
You need to multiply 10 to this two as well and make it 20 so	0
Please walk around and look at your classmates thinking on their whiteboard you have 30 seconds go	0
I am going to exit out of here	0
Yes	0
Draw your triangle first	0
Im only going to give you about three more seconds	0
sixteen slash four 32 slash five 64 slash six dont worry you will not have to write all the numbers	0
When you are done math boxes five four and two	0
Thats what I said	0
What	0
Answer makes sense	0
Thank you for sharing	0
x one y one sorry	0
Or it would be bigger by	0
Theyre on the back	0
Yes	0
Ah yes we just had to do the three listed in the front right	0
Oh come on	0
If youre a black card Id like for you to share first	0
Im going to split this up into sixths so if I divide each of my thirds in half theyll be sixths	0
We are on the home stretch for today	0
70 times eight is a lot easier than 70 equals multiplication equals	0
Fourfifths fivesixths and sixeighths	0
I am more than happy to let everyone retake but you need to show me that you actually spent some time reviewing it	0
Let s hear what he  has to say and maybe change his mind	0
There we go	0
Im going to draw what Maggie did because its kind of cool	0
Okay Zachary so just do your best	0
Okay	0
Okay well lets look	0
And I want to double this which would give me two milliliters of blue paint six milliliters of yellow paint and eight milliliters of total paint	0
Were  just going to write that first one because thats really where were going to focus our energy today	0
Is 145	0
Okay	0
What you are going to do is I m going to have someone read the sentence above	0
A slope of one would look like this	0
Okay	0
Very good	0
I think it slows you down	0
Yes	0
Youre giving me four but thats the ycoordinate I think	0
Okay	0
Each of these problems today has a lot of steps	0
But I dont know if I can see everybodys there we go see Phillips	0
You dont pay me enough	0
Its okay with this	0
I understand that your rule works	0
No thats okay	0
And lets see what Timing is like its about to be 218	0
Same thing the top	0
You need to make sure	0
Everybody but us	0
So I would like you write 1 and 23 down	0
Now we need to think about fractions because were using multiplication with fractions	0
Okay	0
Look for 412	0
I barely stepped on it	0
You as well	0
Oh	0
And if youre having trouble finding them Ive actually gotten a lot of emails the past week or two about people asking Mr G I cant find the Monday assignment	0
His favorite mathmatician is Euclid and his favorite artist is Leonardo da Vinci	0
Let me see	0
Generally you had it right	0
Heres the next topic conversation	0
The  chapstick exactly like what we just did I hope you took good notes	0
All right	0
Okay hold on please	0
Lets move on to our next one	0
You are going to write these using the powers of	0
I still dont understand the logic of why you switched the numbers	0
If these had more if any of these had more than one arrow then that would not be a function	0
Yeah	0
One two three	0
I dont even know who those two papers are	0
Good we can start reviewing the answers	0
I remember that two wait three fourths is larger than two  thirds by one twelfth or two twentyfourths	0
Good	0
We also have one two three four five six seven groups of information	0
I was wmpollcom	0
Please write your response	0
You can go even smaller than that	0
Nice	0
On numbers formed right here	0
Okay	0
Id have to eat this whole thing Id have to hold it like this	0
One	0
All right lets make a mapping diagram	0
But theres some extra things for each of these that we can figure out about the diagonals	0
Okay	0
Lets see if this is going to let me play it	0
And  180 inches	0
This is	0
We just complicated things a whole lot	0
But I wanted you to find a number of ways to come up with it so	0
Were going to hit record	0

One tenth he says confidently	0
Figure out how theyre the same and how theyre different	0
Well not your brains on your microphone but you guys know what I mean	0
These are	0
Oh	0
See if you can understand solve it if you do it like this	0
You can move them around stack them on top of each other	0
So try again Im not because you should be able to get in	0
Oh	0
Over here you could also say theres one person then you could say theres three groups of two theres three groups of two which is six plus three plus five plus seven	0
the multisteps	0
Which is what you found	0
You will know you are successful when I can use multiples of the divisor to divide multiples of the divisor to divide	0
Then once youre into Google classroom you should open up an assignment that looks something like this	0
Its okay if youre still getting logged in	0
Youre going to have another person	0
I like fifty	0
Okay	0
Five plus five plus five plus five	0

This is saying like if you take two small angles you add them together you get the whole big angle that is there	0
Why isnt it the minus seven X	0
Yes I know	0
I got something different	0
But I think its really important to kind of be able to see how these triangles are the same	0
Are we solving the problem yet	0
Okay so my friends up until this point you have only been asked to	0
Right	0
You guys can check yours from here	0
So I would like to calculate what the surface area is of the square A B C D	0
You and the person across from each Jane Ill do that you and the person across from you are going to be competing against each other	0
okay	0
I want to try that when I get home	0
Theres just different angles	0
Okay	0
This person 100 is person 100	0
Remember we are using our fractions circles to solve them	0
This would be 8 x 5 is 40 and then times 9 would be 3610	0
Theres the fact that it doesnt change if you move the points around the circle	0
Okay	0
Im trying to build a bigger model	0
Okay	0
Youre looking really good on this one	0
I dont cut this out do I	0
I know	0
Thats perfect	0
I need to exit out three rows so I want you all to do what Im doing	0

Three times 40 minus negative 10 you get 120	0
Okay thank you	0
No	0
Help me out with it	0
That is being able to explain your representation	0
Okay my beautiful loves	0
Oh thats fine too	0
Dan would you join Chloe and Julia	0
Both have benefits and both have some drawbacks	0
They are right eh also all of the ways that you all did it	0
Is it a good time	0
So its worth half of what a quiz normally is	0
For the  behavior yes	0
multiple answers	0
or where Im multiplying I line it up	0
The other two get the other part	0
Now remember were only multiplying in this step	0
Okay	0
Hes going to buy six packages	0
If I take	0
Thats a lot of bananas that is a ton of bananas	0
Okay	0
Its not 56	0
Were just going to do one	0
Yes	0
Youre supposed to do it by the denominator	0
Or fifty times ten equals	0
Go	0
Huh	0
I guess it should	0
If you write it this way hopefully that helps you	0
If these are parallel then you can say something like this	0
We have to have time to explain our thinking	0
Lets say this was clue number two	0
Okay	0
Same thing	0
All right now I have two m equals 26	0
Yes Im trying to see which time we have	0
Um okay	0
The quotient of three divided by W Theres that word Andrea	0
Good morning fifth graders	0
Its going to be less than a whole	0
Try the next one	0
So that is twentyeight point five thats it	0
And then the next last slide	0
If youve checked your own work you have the entire text in front of you so you can check the other assignments as well	0
All right	0
Again that would be the right answer for that	0
So I thought that you know maybe what well do is  well start with some of the things that confused me and  maybe you can help straighten me out	0
Bless you	0
Okay thats not reSSy racing	0
A building	0
Then when the longer hand gets to the 12 then the little hand will move	0
Okay so your focus should be on the person speaking and your math book not on each other	0
Ok	0
Now you can see that when you have a Y  MX  B equation then you might notice that Verizon did not start at zerozero	0
Okay so just want us to see this three 3x changed into a three thats all because because this is a three then you solve it	0
You couldve started	0
And yes you should be writing this down	0
No	0
So heres the fractions that I want you guys to write down on your paper	0
34 times 3	0
We struggled with this on the test	0
Okay keep going Charlie	0
Just page 25	0
One two three four five six seven eight nine 10	0
Yes you guys are on it	0
This time please explain it Ikeda	0
I think it says SIO	0
Now the reason I chose 20 is because its going to help us see the pattern that I wanted you guys to see a little bit more because the secret to finding the answer to this is finding the pattern and unfortunately none of you found the pattern	0
Okay	0
Weve got a couple of minutes	0
Okay I am thinking	0
Yes	0
Here we go	0
Lets see if I can find it here	0
Now I dont know if its clear for everybody so that instead of writing here look the second passage of the transparency	0
Let me let me see wh Let me see the answers	0
Its more like a process and so Im going to go back and I want you to compare to what you did	0
We know that 18 we have 18 and something	0
Should be linked in here	0
This should be a six which means we can do another 365 and another year	0
Yay	0
Yeah	0
So lets think about it some more	0
Okay now if you fill in all these in betweens then youre gonna have Great table	0
So good job in realizing that	0
Okay I think that might take actually a little bit of time to do	0
Now we go down here to C On this one we are not multiplying by two anymore	0
Youre writing 021 plus 00 two one and youre lining the numbers up line the decimal and the numbers up the decimal is what you have to line up	0
Okay lets look at the rest of your table	0
Five	0
Okay	0
I think that in the future these ways tend to be shorter and then these ways	0
Nice job	0
Wrong	0
You think the boats the biggest	0
So this ones a rhombus	0
I originally used R in mind	0
Very good	0
When we think of maybe what we did in third grade we mightve had squares in here and we counted our squares	0
Yes how much is shaded in blue how much is shaded in red how much is shaded in all and a number sentence that represents it	0
No nobody understood it at first but then the more you did it and the more we talked about it the more you understand it	0
Its that easy huh do you agree with him sure oh wait no	0
All right thank you	0
We cant forget that one up here	0
So just a reminder y intercept is where it crosses the y axis with 06	0
Its a really good idea to make sure that you can do all types of problems	0
Some of them are pretty tricky	0
So lets come back at 221 meet back at 221 Okay and as always I recommend that you drink some water you get up you stretch	0
Okay	0
But this triangle here	0
Yes so the money on the yaxis and the weeks on the xaxis okay	0
So right now erase your boards markers away for now and all I need you to get out is a colored pencil so scoot into your desks and you need a colored pencil and Im going to pass out quite a bit of sheets of paper	0
Were just adding on to what weve done before	0
So right now I need you to get started	0
5 1	0
Okay this is another nice one down here	0

Is in between two and two and in between two and two and we decide that median is two	0
So thats what it means to be able to double	0

So youre asked to make it less than 2000 yen so	0
Make her answer it do not just give her the answer	0
Lets see	0
The image is what you transform	0
If you look here thats been here all along but you ve never noticed	0
Okay	0
So you actually would have four shares or four boxes four piles that you need to create	0
From B you go over three and then you go down one	0
So again were going to use two a lot but we can use other factors to find equivalent fractions	0
What	0
Its smaller	0
So heres my picture for Cassidy	0
Kneetoknee	0
Do we have to erase	0
Bye	0
What	0
Uh says sub well take Substitute words and change them into numbers	0
Five is greater than two and then  And then fivetenths the last one so we know thats the greatest	0
You said that pretty quietly	0
That would be a subtraction problem	0
Look for this continuity in the behavior	0
B is at	0
All right so 62	0
Before you actually have your test next week	0

Rulers because yardsticks would be too long but a ruler would be a good size to figure out the size if you want squares and they would help	0
Well see	0
Yes	0
Draw a picture and you can count the pieces	0
Just use the marker to make it look like a four	0
Very good	0
Lonnie you were saying that its a stepbystep way to do something	0

And Connor I appreciate so much that when something doesnt make sense in your head you ask questions and you advocate for yourself	0
Where is Clay	0
Im getting rulers for you	0
It was Julia Eric and Haley	0

hit 50 but now its not sounding so bad	0
Answer right here	0
Yeah	0
Right here	0
If you think you know your means then use it	0
Okay	0
m is the slope B is the y intercept	0
So you had to turn both those into twelfths	0
And because this is the last part that were going to add in so because every every number in the domain over here has exactly one arrow leaving	0
Yeung Wan Chi	0
I am ready	0
Like I said this is already in your notes	0
Now we have the vertex of two secants outside the circle	0
Those two match	0
Yes and then do how many 112 would fit on there	0
All right	0
All right and Stephen make sure I can see your work on every single question	0
Okay congruent means the same or equal	0
Yes very good	0
Bye	0
Go right now	0
So not only do you need to find an answer but you also need to prove it	0
Just like before	0
So I think we all meant that	0
I see there are some of you who you know you have to get to 85	0
Okay	0
There are some recorders	0
Umm	0
Yay	0
Five times 12 so five seven and a half	0
Starting here	0
Part of being a confident mathematician is knowing how to use lots of different strategies and then finding the one that works best for you	0
Okay	0
There are nine members in the group	0
Walk about the room	0
Pass them down	0
All right your learning objectives for today Ill be able to identify the intercepts of a linear function	0
So three divided by one is three and four divided by one is four	0
On page 220 and Im sorry 219 and 220	0
Okay then theres one with two points as well	0
Yes	0
Those of you standing start making a circle around the room	0
Here I would of said the first person gets one quarter of 200 and the other person gets three quarters of 200 dollars	0
One package costs 24 because theres eight of the package each one costs three and then you times that by 13 for sandwiches one package costs how much	0
Once youve got a conclusion from your formula then you can write about it somewhere on that um sheet	0
Take a picture of it in Schoology	0
Okay	0
Landon	0
One of those groups would have 6 in them	0
Okay all right lets talk about lets talk about function notation	0
Four	0
So all right theres two right angle triangles	0
There are actually three different ways that you can make the park square so you and your team are going to try to figure those out	0
Er Camille get back to your seat please well look at I would just like to show you something because theres theres the idea its we we will listen to to what Valentine says and then well try to see what what doesnt match in her story	0
Then copy down four shares equals 200 dollars	0

Compare your prediction to problem two	0
Take the decimal off	0
Could you turn your microphone on	0
That one only has monomials on the left or the right	0
Thats a quick and easy mistake to make	0
We just add those two but since it makes a whole youre grabbing another slice	0
Yeah	0
Move them around a bit and make sure they stay	0
Okay	0
Why dont you put all those books on the floor	0
Remember we are using division and fractions	0
You can go back to the square if you need to or go ahead to the circle	0
Sentence Diegos line was Sorry	0
Journal page	0
Here is your problem here	0
We know that theres three equal sides for both triangles	0
All right	0
Yeah and then I did five times 25 one four one times four and one times 20	0
But its fine	0
Nothing does nothing for me	0
Thats  we just learned shortcuts	0
After today we have two weeks and one day	0
Meredith did too but then uh so then uh she thought to think of a  bigger model then I thought that then maybe the greens would be  something like one twelfth but then we figured out that would be  sixteenths then I put them up there	0
So you have to add the exponents	0
Can you write here	0
He broke that up into parts that would be like partial products and got the same answer	0
Voices off in three two one	0
We look at four ways to solve it	0
Today	0
And then we keep going	0
Well mark it with letter Pi its marked as Pi and its called Ludolf formula	0
Lets learn something new	0
Or 510 I mean	0
Perfect completely correct right	0
Yeah Zach can you see my screen	0
Close your eyes	0
Yes	0
I  heard I heard some	0
But from the data we have on this graph it shows us 12 inches	0
We started doing the poster and like giving each other ideas	0
Hes just trying to say that theres 66s is 1  whole	0
I colored just in each section	0
I kind of got the hang of it I kind of	0
All right	0
This is as if Sadie had 20 kids in her class and we have 13 wanting to go outside and seven  We have 20 students total and we have 13 who want to go outside and seven stay inside	0
That is tricks to treats	0
Yes it did	0
Okay	0
Okay but	0
And lets talk about these types of angles below	0
Go	0
We know that its rise on the top run on the bottom	0
Victor hows your sister doing	0
So on your objectives for today I can solve problems when I know a ratio and a total amount and I can compare ratios using a part to part to whole strategy	0
Hey	0
Its where you dont  as theyre regular numbers	0
We were placing the decimal based on our estimates	0
Okay	0
So you found one that s too big as Jeff said	0
That doesnt make any sense	0
Good idea	0
Now do that part	0
Go around the other way go backwards	0
Why did you do it times 20	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
Because of these two so explain how you got that to these two because they dont get it	0
I liked that you guys are thinking about the size of this	0
Some of them go all the way across a line really should have extend all the way through and have arrows on either side	0
Go	0
Youre gonna put three numbers and they cant repeat any of the numbers	0
Now multiplication facts means were learning how to multiply zero through nine	0
Okay so 14 is 28	0
Hes talking about the slices one fifth is bigger	0
Yeah we got everybody	0
All right	0
All right	0
When we get into partial products you guys will enjoy it I promise	0
There you go	0
First in your own words describe the two strategies you know for multiplying fractions by a whole number	0
Very good	0
12 plus two equals four so three divided by or 12 divided by three equals four	0
Owen Im going to walk where I want to	0
Thank you so much	0
Seven works	0
Excellent my loves	0
Weve got one five three and nine	0
Im hearing a lot of talking from table two	0
So look at this picture	0
Youve split them into three groups having three potatoes and then one third of one	0
And light green for fourths	0
So 25 means 25 per 100	0
Say theyre getting paid every day then Kaia would have more money	0
Three minutes	0
OK just because people will not form the equation	0
I might do half and half	0
Now the next one 485	0
All right	0
Because I need your attention up here	0
Pear Deck shared screen Pear Deck shared screen	0
Yes Clay because if you read this this is what it tells you to do	0
Shes drawn her three cards	0
Okay but then what she found out was uhoh if I divide this by six to give me my one when I divide 10 by six I get sad face because it doesnt work	0
This is the table	0
I think that ones fairly straightforward	0
So I can see you	0
We have 172 students	0
I think it would be a good idea to start putting a little bit of your thinking on the poster	0
and you apply the equation then indeed you will get my first rightangled side squared	0
Stephen did you give Cecilia	0
Those will go together to make one more group of 34	0
What this means is you are going to multiply the base number that many times	0
All right	0
Oh you cant	0
The inverse operation of times two is divided by two divided divided by two	0
The Hunter part	0
Turn the page and youre doing that one	0
Okay	0
Take 12 each and give me the rest back	0
Maybe we might not just have time	0
I see no numbers anywhere around the blue triangle	0
If we add that up he gets 163	0
they got the greens out and he told me to put four on it and just leave this one out	0
Okay	0
Seven two one five	0
When I look on your board I see you have an It looks like an addition problem	0
Thats why when people want to remember something they write it down	0
MiStudents	0
Pretty boring person	0
I cant do seven minus eight and I have a zero here that I can go to	0
Largest back there	0
Looks all right to me	0
Put in your best effort while youre here every day	0
Number two example problem one it looks like its  but I got 13	0
One two  three boards down	0
Now we have this and this	0
And Maarten	0
So that you dont annoy one another	0
So we should do it in this manner	0
So you might be able to think about it that way	0
And I can have Zach bring your pieces	0
All right	0
Add them together	0
Hadley did you give me your cards back	0
Okay so Im going to just write S equals four for that first one	0
Do you have to break the 31	0
So if you would do it again you would have one thousand  two hundred thirtysix	0
Clay	0
Nice job	0
Right	0
Okay now listen my friends Im going to have you work on this tomorrow because I want to make sure that what youre really looking at is a rule that fits the directions of what they are talking about	0
If today you were a little bit let me see your eyes	0
You could have done it like this	0
So we have to make one big um	0
What Robert says	0
Thats also how we graph one of those lines because then we just put those two dots on the grid and we graph them connected with a straight line	0
So because two half would be a fourth	0
The larger of the fractions larger of the fractions	0
Okay	0
Amy I would like you to go meet with Michael	0
Okay	0
What you need out in front of you is you have your math journal	0
Threetenths	0
I just brought one to you	0
Think of a number story that would start out with five of something	0
Were more condensed	0
This is M prime prime	0
Youre going to draw a line that connects the points and then were going to figure out what does that data mean	0
In our math boxes this is a skill that weve practiced before	0
Youre ready to change	0
It doesnt have to just be the flat Virgin	0
They are numbers that can be written as products of 10s and you know how we can write it	0
Is that besides the one in the factors of eight theyre all counting by two	0
Key thing here were going to go over this on Friday	0
Those of you at home I hope you have drawn a number line that youve taken from zero to 14 and you have divided it into groups of 34	0
When were talking about our remainder I want you to look at what fraction of a piece is this	0
Approximately 30 numbers nearest to the tenth decimal	0
Damian watch	0
Now you are going to	0
No I need to see you guys all four agree	0
Yes	0
Thats presuming that was a story about people the second person could have been companies I suppose gets 150	0
Okay	0
But they technically are because what youre drawing is not lines	0
Very good	0
Go to  Then it should say	0
He said well lets just draw a picture five pieces in this one because my denominator is five three of them filled in because my numerator is three	0
Im going to cross that one off and were going to go on	0
So slides three and four are open for you right now	0
I thought it would be 15 and then we can get 16 because	0
This looks pretty easy	0
Should it go right here	0
But since this is really the first exposure youve had to this concept were just going to do it together	0
You got your slope youve got your y intercept	0
I can use visual models to divide whole numbers by unit fractions	0
Yes	0
Maybe write in the middle so we  could build them both ways and see if theres a difference	0
This is the answer	0
And then you have a little warmup question today	0
Thats your y intercept because its right there	0
So now that we have the same number of miles and we can see their minutes we can easily compare these two values	0
Id say youd scale both of them down so you get to the unit rate	0
Then from drive	0
It would be a reallife map and if youre  and you have to change places to go	0
Its not improper because 86 is over 87	0
Okay	0
Thats great but thats still not right next to it	0
I thought that that was true	0
Math Land	0
Are you hitting that with your head	0
I didnt have like the exact amount but I do know they have eight pizzas or they have seven pizzas	0
Median is one way	0
Okay	0
And just a reminder four is the slope	0
Youre going to use two pieces of tape to tape this lab sheets into the next clean page in your Chromebook	0
This will be our practice	0
You just go back and forth being the one	0
You should be able to see your partners steps they took today	0
So Im going to write in the equation here	0
Im just going to make it  Im going to go minus one is  Im also going to go like this go plus three	0
So for this one for these next two you dont actually have to write anything	0
I have 3 and 13 and 1 and 12	0
Okay	0
You did it	0
You can put your hands down	0
Good	0
Walk over here with me please	0
330300	0
So were going to start with our mental math	0
Two times this quantity divided by two just means X  3	0
So Ill probably  because third period didnt finish Im most likely going to give you a little bit of extra time next class but not a lot	0
I need to redo it	0
She was getting ready to get them to you	0
Can you turn your eyes this way please	0
So were just gonna write opposite side opposite angles congruent	0
Remember youre not solving	0
How do you know that your mixed number is another name for 21 fifths	0
You need some more	0
Okay kneetoknee	0
Well I dont think so	0
I am going to share you are going and Im going to do this on the whiteboard friends	0
Later Ill give them to you	0
Good	0
Oh Ive put green thats my print	0
You do not have enough space on your paper unless you want to use the backside to do this	0
Our handydandy little guy should already give you the answer to that question so go ahead and fill it in	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Sure	0
Three times one is three	0
Every single day	0
So domain is the x values	0
Not quite a million	0
Take back to where you were	0
You could also just	0
And so youre going to feel sometimes like you have information overload what I need you to do is just relax and just do it	0
Okay	0
Hamster gets more treats than one animal and less than the other	0
That s good	0
This shows us that it is the most popular in Mr Lees class	0
Okay	0
Oh I know	0
That is correct	0
All right	0
Wait so whats our focus today	0
Thirds a little bit harder but I know if I know this is a half I know that a third is a little bit less than that	0
Like draw an arrow to them	0
This is something many of you have probably seen before	0
Okay now see what it says there youve done that youve done that	0
You have two and you take away a whole and then another half youre left with a half	0
The first way that were going to do it is with your ordered value bar graphs	0
Please find page 50 in your note catcher 50 is a great number its half of 100	0
Mac and cheese	0
Once you have finished sailboat one you may connect it when you are  and then we will move to the next one	0
Thats okay	0
Its about thinking I can do this	0
Before we start to go over this homework well go over some of the rules which we did not discuss	0
ready	0
cameras on	0
Um this is just the introduction to fractions	0
10 come in a package times 2 times 9	0
Why dont I leave you a few minutes and think about explaining this to us	0
Because if you look at the 1 and if you make that into the 99 form basically it would be 100 and that ones 99 so its 100	0
Okay	0
Absolutely	0
Okay	0
It appears something will show up between minus 10 and 40	0
I was going to ask Mrs Phillips if next week I thought a wonderful activity for the class would be to do it on the board a big number line	0
Its working now right	0
I see two brave students	0
Okay	0
And this is 70	0
If you re doing  things for surface area I m stamping finding out how many  of these stamps	0
I would like you to divide the fraction twoeighths by two	0
So were going to say I think the typical number is	0
Is that the compound inequality on the left or the compound inequality on the right	0
And you need to know yesterday Zoe came to me with a problem when she was playing fraction of	0
But why does it say like ordering fractions when its like normal numbers	0
Then you guys are writing their explanation and making it better	0
In another words you are saying that the one half you are  splitting that and then you know where to place those numbers	0
Its a 10th of the number	0
If you think its going to be Haven you write Haven on your second line	0
Okay so that would be partial products	0
12 is bigger	0
It is 110 which is 10	0
So the way you show this in a picture is you make a box or a circle or whatever for domain you make a box or a circle for range	0
Id be more than happy to do that trade with any one of you	0
Okay	0
Now color in 23 Clay	0
So your strategy You just wanted to tell me Im wrong	0
Perfect	0
I	0
Who should come along	0
Youre going to write a number sentence that models the amount of the casserole that group B took and show or explain how you use the picture to solve the problem	0
So flipping over the X axis	0
That is an estimate	0
And our first problem today says At  Middle School football games the students and teachers run a concession stand to raise money	0
See how now theyre all going around in the same direction	0
C is going to be x5	0
Now I want you to the next person in the threesome with the shortest hair	0
I was going ask if I could do the last one	0
I m very confused	0
Thank you	0
Okay	0
So you just have number six on page 163 and then you have six problems on page 164	0
Also I think the book will be taller because I doubled the Y coordinate	0
And once again 15 plus 18 is 33	0
Its plus 32500	0
Okay so we didnt solve it though Landon	0
Because on the chart it says seven greens I mean yeah seven greens and three yellows	0
I  didn t count the last two thirds	0
Yeah	0
The new sailboat was in double	0
So lets draw five pieces here	0
But you guys are right were going to do the LCM	0
Pick a problem Missy	0
Okay so really what youre figuring out here and were gonna talk a lot about these sorts of slopes today	0
Okay	0
Okay so I want you to write at least two fraction addition problems that have a sum of seven sixths	0
Here is what I want to do	0
And then and then youve got four parts	0
Now we look at this sentence we wrote and Serena even gave us the operation really but if we had said like I take away six points every time from the card	0
And weve got x plus 12 x minus two and x plus 12	0
Thats amazing	0
Can we put our whiteboards away	0
That is US traditional	0
Im sorry	0
Study that yeah	0
Are we still going to get our recess since we	0
Shh	0
Why	0
I love how so many of you heard me	0
Right theyre not going to give you the fractions of money	0
1 would be 100100 and then you have 20 left	0
Two	0
I think that s real interesting	0
So thats going to get you up to 10 boxes would be 80 bars	0
Yes	0
And then you have these four pieces of five H	0
So y two is right here at zero	0
The rest is zeros	0
My rule takes the number	0
Nice	0
If we have one group doing every other beat	0
Nice	0
Except these are the answers	0
So we could also do eight tenths	0
Thats right	0
I want you to do it by the way it makes sense to you	0
Models usually help you solve and well	0
Nice	0
Oh hey uh	0
288 divided by 58	0
Money One equals 144  12W Theres your homework	0
Two on the blackboard with the three in the book you have five results	0
All of these pouches are nine because they all have to be the same in this problem and it should add up to 30 on both sides	0
Numerator the number of parts we have	0
The answer is its just one that doesnt make sense	0
You try the next one fivefourths	0
Eight	0
All right for the second one I want us to notice a couple of things	0
Okay so if you draw these triangles in between your points and you really only have to do it in one in between any two points and then youll youre fine but the slope is three over one	0
G and P	0
because	0
One cup cheese 10 ounces	0
Okay so page four if you could flip over to page four	0
The last two assignments	0
Just rewrite your rule	0
So youve got about 30 no you got about 27 minutes to get going on this	0
Okay	0
And when A lost the scores were far	0
Why cant we have the slant length of the cone	0
Yes but I would rather for you I know youre at this level most people arent though Id rather you just do an addition symbol three times instead of that but yes your answer is correct	0
Pyramid prism	0
Dude lets get a bandaid	0
I quadruple my number then I half my number then I add one then I multiply it by 3 and then I add 7 to get 12	0
I feel like were not quite ready to do that	0
Now we have this graph here though and we actually have some really nice points that it goes through	0
and hopefully you got an answer thats bigger than the perimeter because youre doing the area	0
cameras on cameras on	0
I feel like theres another one but I cant think of it	0
Tthen your homework for tonight is just keep it going with what weve been doing	0
Number two were going down	0
Our brains are kind of used to the other kind of problem	0
If you would join that that would be great	0
Oh your mic is not working buddy	0
Yes	0
And Im going to deal I have a seven a four	0
SS right three two one okay	0
No add	0
Im gonna pick the one with the neatest handwriting so far its whoever This is they can know that I think they have the neatest handwriting out of all the ones Ive seen	0
Okay so lets do this guys five minutes to make sure you have your box and whisker plot of this and your box and whisker plot of this so that we can talk about it in just a second	0
For number two 78   22	0
In the rules they told you you couldnt have that	0
If you want to retake it	0
You didnt have to go by multiples or anything because theres no fraction to divide by	0
Ill wait	0
Write a rule then describe what you think the new picture would look like and be specific about how you think the book will change	0
Okay thats fixed that	0
Okay	0
Wrote down eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24	0
Go to the next door and look at the 10th and its like Margo said its lower than five so the eight stays the same	0
Im on it	0
Half meter 50	0
Because I liked Audra s trick of finding out what one was in  the other problem	0
Summer you had the fraction you got ninefourths  you got ninefourths	0
Okay	0
That something will happen	0
Were got to move on to exit tickets so I will show you the answers very quickly	0
Theres just one last step	0
Im going to actually Lindsey take this one away	0
So we can look at the rule that you have here I am really looking for a rule that can help me figure out	0
So I am hearing some agreement  on that and that is where you would place it	0
Hedging their bets a little bit	0
So my big ask is that when you submit work especially when youre submitting pictures like that really stop and think Is Miss Calus going to be able to see all the hard work that Ive done inside of here	0
All right	0
All right	0
Im going to come back to you	0
So we can get to check them with a calculator	0
Not yet we were just looking around	0
What do we do now	0
Please use back of the paper and think about it a little	0
Yes	0
Wait what	0
But take it out	0
Okay which is greater	0
Thats not S squared	0
Okay	0
Im a little nervous	0
You are right	0
very precise with your bar graphs	0
Draw the line	0
He did it	0
So notice I split this up into the whole number and the fraction in each case	0
Nope	0
Is 45	0
But you think so	0
Okay so lets do this	0
A little parking lot	0
So yeah I talked about it when I was drawing your multiplication chart	0
No you do it here	0
And 23	0
Mrs Filbert is not in here and Im hoping that poor Mrs Filbert doesnt walk in tomorrow thinking that was the day we are working but its okay	0
Take your hats off	0
Oh almost	0
That s good	0
There arent the same number of numbers	0
than count things onebyone and find the number	0
to 59	0
Matteo that was your mic	0
Yes	0
That is for tomorrow	0
I know	0
We have two and onefourths cups and the question says Is there enough  They have a quart of  water	0
This is a quart	0
Substitute	0
For Maurine	0
Go to page 124 and go to problem four	0
Martin did a good job I suppose	0
Thats what that means blank of something else	0
Thats enough	0
Combine the ys add plus y is two y minus 40	0
Do you want to go home is that what you mean	0
right and then this would be the top part this would be the one this would be the two	0
No	0
Voices are off	0
Yessetyyes	0
So our goal for right now is to be able to convert from fractions to decimals	0
Were going to extend our thinking here	0
Secant of circumference	0
Yes that one wont be explained until the next paragraph	0
were going to do some of this together	0
I have another question	0
So then we just 540 divided by nine	0
You just didnt see the next part	0
So lets use division and lets divide both of these by four	0
You have to be able to do this with fraction circles	0
As many as possible	0
Yes	0
Im just going to write them	0
The other homework	0
So lets go up a couple times	0
No	0
If I say if you got	0
Okay	0
I see Calvin put yours to the side yours doesnt work anymore	0
All right	0
Okay I want to see what your graphs look like for this one	0
Could I see that paper	0
STUDENT in pair C V V V C	0
We did 3 14 and then 3 24 and then 3 34	0
He gave us exact	0
Okay how many pieces are in that whole pizza	0
You are going to go into your student login page	0
So one two five six	0
Okay	0
Because when you laugh when youre saying it that could tell me that youre trying to be funny and is now a good time to be funny in math class	0
Um so our learning intentions today are important	0
Yes	0
David is sure	0
Bring those	0
Right	0
So earlier when you guys were talking about  Well I know that a quarter a quarter the piece of money is 25 and its also 14	0
In time youll realize that these exact answers will not be useful	0
You can always look to the page and work on your map boxes if youre done	0
Im going to erase them	0
If you were in the back of the room with me I already taught you this that includes you you you you	0
All right	0
But for included its kind of just like its just a phrase to talk about sides and angles	0
If you have a shorter number you can make it longer	0
It goes up by one	0
So if you write it as a fraction thats really telling you your rise over your run you go down five over two from one to the next	0
Yes	0
Is this open reader	0
For P you just fill in 10 not 11 P times 10	0
Yes yes	0
I should see some equations on your paper and then be prepared to share	0
Yeah	0
Oh you got it	0
So when I solve this problem Im going to have almost all of it	0
its figuring out what numbers we need to use and what mathematical process we need to use to solve the equation	0
Youre looking at page 169	0
Eighteighteenths	0
Okay so see most people with a really great graph here	0
Thats all	0
Yes	0
They also spread out	0
8x91	0
Oh Lindsey has some good ones	0
So first we need to do one fourth	0
Yes	0
Maybe talk to your neighbors say What do you	0
Okay so were just warming up here	0
Uh huh	0
Now theres two parts to that	0
And not only is that a common multiple but its the least common multiple	0
Okay math show me those note catchers please	0
I have ten tiles in this bag	0
Each need to have their own mixture	0
You are going to use your array skills to be able to determine how many dots you see	0
Okay lets see how were doing over here	0
This is three comma three	0
The table lists the prices and the number of items sold	0
How would I write this in exponential form I want to see it on your warmup	0
But I have like three questions left	0
And this is fifth grade expectations	0
Okay so lets go here	0
I can skip count by 8s to get to 24	0
Okay so I show this persons work because I think this is a great example	0
It would go pretty close to zero	0
Im going to stop everybody because we have a misconception	0
I cant see it	0
Nine minus four	0
Conor where are you	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Im talking about just the two	0
Paycheck of some kind	0
No that is not 99	0
So like I want you to actually graph until Antonia has zero money left	0
They both have 10 as a factor so we could simplify this to 14	0
Oh sure	0
No	0
So if Im looking at one my tick mark is going to be at one if Im looking at a half my tick marks would be at zero halves a half two halves three halves four halves	0
I had one at 53 54 plus 54 is 108	0
So its kind of comparing two different things	0
So if you have found this you already have calculated it	0
This would be two thirds	0
If its on the line stays the same	0
Because fourth graders we need to be writing this stuff down when I put it down and not when I asked you about it 10 minutes later	0
But you didnt tell me you needed a new one	0
Back at your desks you have one sheet of paper	0
No	0
Okay	0
You wouldn t be willing to tell that to everybody	0
Yeah	0
Two squared is four and four minus three is one	0
Youre done	0
Awesome	0
Okay so now they actually have Amys original diagram and then theyre going to double it	0
Lets go in order	0
All right people	0
Like leave them at school if youre going to leave them somewhere	0
All right there we go	0
Excellent	0
Okay	0
Say the question again	0
Round those write down and stand when you are done	0
You can do a mixed number or an improper fraction	0
I think I did the right way today and I shared the student link with you rather than the teacher link	0
Im just gonna work my way backwards	0
Yeah I dont think Jeff is either	0
Even if you went one two three four five six seven eight	0
All right guys watch	0
Are you going to use addition subtraction	0
Thank you Hannah	0
That little brief jaunt through that four week unit	0
like he doesnt he just put the boat in	0
Now one of you was finished a bit earlier	0
Okay perfect	0
Uh we have this one	0
6 times 10 to the power of one is 60	0
So even though it has a common denominator or common numerator and I know people like Marie know that one half is just bigger than a quarter I still want you to find my common denominator prove it	0
Were talking about why fractions need common denominators	0
Okay	0
Here we worked with powered numbers that have the same main numbers	0
All right were looking pretty good	0
So I want the smallest first	0
Hm	0
Joel I need yours	0
You guys did a great job with that	0
Very good	0
I agree	0
Okay	0
Begin	0
I see some good work going on	0
Absolutely	0
Its okay	0
Yes	0
So I said that	0
Good job	0
Awesome	0
Not open because of the or equals two which includes the dot now	0
Whoa that was good thinking	0
And a common factor for them is three	0
And thats where I got my 5 from	0
And if you have somebody specific that helped you you can also give them a shoutout	0
So my question to you is is this book redrawn using a straight edge	0
So I wanted to be really clear about like Oh well this is just these are just the points that are convenient with this slope	0
Okay	0
If the rest are finished yes	0
I can say Okay my ear told me I was going to have two questions	0
That is my question	0
Titan finish this sentence	0
So this is x this is y	0
When I do that my y goes away and I get two F is equal to k minus y	0
It would be 23 because wed have to put these into another bag my answer would become 23	0
Youre sharp	0
Were almost there	0
So when you  you put it into all of them do you count all empty spaces	0
Ichiro	0
All right	0
Those are my choice	0
But Laurie didnt	0
The other day I was with	0
So three fourths is more than that	0
Please cover your work	0
Most people here do a great job of that	0
B and C on your own	0
Okay Ms Roberto so I walked around to a couple of people and I looked at some answers Robertos explanation explained to me that he understood	0
It says my hidden point and my partners guesses	0
Your eyes should be on your paper	0
Its right here	0
Okay	0
Switch positions or the other person is talking now and try to fill that time	0
Well were going to tell you your SS to do	0
Okay so this is onetenth	0
And like Carter said he gets parts of companies	0
I dont know what happened	0
Lets go	0
So so youre going to need the two sheets and two sixsided dice	0
I guess	0
Today were also going to work on mapping diagrams	0
If I put a four in I get a seven	0
Johnson maybe try to refresh the Pear Deck tab	0
Our last question	0
Were going to add one more thing here though	0
The correct answers the level of percentage of correct answers for those three problems right in a row were 41 26 and 45	0
I know where they were on day five	0
Right	0
We did multiplication in real world problems	0
All right	0
Were done	0
I dont think I can explain it too good	0
I thought I said that	0
Good thing Mrs Dukes here cuz Mrs Strathom is losing her mind	0
You could use an algorithm to solve an equation	0
I know this is tough	0
I expect the numbers to be used in your explanation of how you knew explaining what you knew about those numbers	0
If you add 120 again	0
Is it right like this	0
Julian I did not give you your book	0
Okay	0
So these are the same	0
Okay	0
You have to start with the basics	0
Its the same as this other one	0
So let me show the agenda one more time	0
They could have miscounted the total number of data points	0
Its laying in the front	0
Product Pilot really works on your multiplication practice	0
They have split into two right triangles	0
I cant put them together	0
Okay just checking	0
Im going to give you a halfpage	0
This	0
When you are writing your algorithm when you are writing your algorithm and thats the expression its what were doing	0
We left the graphing for pictures behind so its just going to make a line graph and connect the points	0
Its a thick black one	0
SS right so now youre going to need a book	0
Also if you see one tenth the way that you say this is how we write it with a one in the tenths place	0
This one I had to use the words wider and taller and how I knew that	0
Pete come meet with Jason	0
Oh lets change color	0
Yes	0
All you need is a pencil and a journal and a ruler	0
Yeah because anything times zero is zero	0
I dont mind	0
Thats like	0
Its going to be a little bit higher than one and a half	0
Maybe you can look at these points that Im points that Im writing in	0
Excellent job	0
If you are not understanding those you are not using your resources	0
Mmhmm	0
Have we missed anything	0
You guys on the couch go with number four here	0
Yeah you dont need to do that	0
First person open them all second person came and closed every other one	0
Ill wait until I hear zero talking out there	0
Lets try that again	0
So look when touched once twice twice three times once three times once three times two times two times one time four times one time two times two times three times one times three times one time three times	0
Try number eight again	0
Its over there	0
So you pay your 12 and then you rent 1 movie so thats an extra dollar	0
Now if we look at the graph and we think about rise and run so your rise is down 10	0
Number six five over three that looks perfect	0
Its there nicely working	0
Thats it	0
You are cruising	0
Theres only one assignment on Google Classroom right now for this class	0
Okay	0
Were going to look at some concert tickets	0
Its a little bit before that for	0
Put the covers back onto your calculators	0
So	0
Pam pam	0
Yeah youre exactly right	0
So in all of this in all of these boxes there are 540	0
He is excited to try hurdles for the first time	0
You  know the height	0
Subtract 4 subtract four were gonna get 44x equals 176 divided by 44	0
Basically 1 and 35	0
I need to see your answer	0
Thats all right I bet it will work on the next slide	0
Which ones greater	0
We missed him though	0
And friends like I say this is a repeat of what you did at home so jogging your memory	0
I dont want there to be any confusion about what SSS means side side side	0
Okay	0
Three X minus two X makes one X	0
Next we are going to use a paper	0
Now you guys have an example of when the narrow diameter is zero	0
All right	0
Hi buddy	0
So X is equal to 200	0
Four	0
Two different   numbers	0
All right	0
Say you guys are taking a reading assessment	0
Wait so whats the half one again	0
Two and three choose then three choose three choose three	0
So thats so those are both called representations	0
Do you see how this 82 double 5 is 10 double 1 is 2	0
Just one	0
Corresponding angles are congruent side lengths are multiplied by the same number	0
Because six matches up with 12 five matches up with 10	0
Okay	0
Mmhm	0
Yes	0
It doesnt go through  though so it cant be proportional but I wanted to talk about specificSSy  be proportional	0
and zero okay	0
Sometimes I grope for words	0
So on average means that they kind of go in the middle	0
Of 36	0
Okay prove it to me	0
So we started out ready right	0
I pulled out 60	0
Alright just to make sure we are still missing  Kurt  G Melody is here now	0
And five vertically	0
And the A goes in the middle to show you that the angle has to be between the two sides	0
Okay lots of different ways to do this	0
Ok  I got to hear a lot of interesting  arguments	0
And compare answers	0
So slope this is where you can see it in the table it goes up by a quarter every time	0
An algorithm	0
Thank you to those of you who have a pen out	0
You and I met and my explanation was different than yours but you were able to prove to me You might come up to me and say Id like to be your partner because I want to make sure that my explanation helped you learn	0
She added that six at the top	0
Wait six problems you solve	0
activity	0
And then if we look at these twoone hundredths fiveone hundredths twentyone hundredths fifty onehundredths they are all in order	0
Okay this is a different algorithm to use	0
Say it again	0
Yes	0
But if you go from here and you go over one up one over one up one this this line right here would be like a slope of one which is steeper than this one	0
One box on the left three boxes on the right	0
One and three	0
T	0
So Tom started with the fractions	0
Cant use multiplication	0
Now shes only doubling the first coordinate in the pair	0
Okay	0
You make him prove it	0
His medium is a pint	0
Put a little negative three above there	0
I want to see what you did	0
Jeff	0
This is the way to get your most positive number 7 and this is the way to get your most negative	0
So what I did was I took 20 and I just started counting but what I did was that every five numbers I I went a new line	0
Okay	0
Okay let me check	0
When youre choosing a name for it try and choose a name that actually means something	0
You disagree	0
One minus one is going to be zero	0
Well yeah you have to find the number problem that goes with the picture the representation card	0
Okay	0
The number never changed or theres nothing else to add there because its the same thing and theyre not two different numbers theyre just one just showing the others theyre basically a mirror just the top of the mirror is not the same	0
doing Well thanks for being here	0
Its prime	0
Lets talk about our two strategies	0
This is	0
All right	0
Youre exactly right Xavier	0
Do what you think you should do on this one	0
Have you ever made your own ChapSticks	0
Do we show at the	0
Go	0
I can t find the brown brown	0
So from your work yesterday I want you to think about a good definition for the word ratio	0
So the surface areas of the triangles together here is four	0
Thursday tomorrow you have your chapter four review	0
Lets say this was from my previous class that you go to King Soopers	0
I need to get those	0
You dont have to do it that way	0
We have about 10 minutes until we need to head up to the library for the book fair preview today	0
Im going to count one two three put a line here one two three	0
She needs to make the trapezoid wider	0
If there were 100	0
Were not going pie degrees because pie degrees is right there	0
Absolutely	0
No	0
I want you to do number four number five and number six	0
Yeah	0
Do we get which one has the most exes or	0
How much food should Josie give the cat each day	0
If I decompose 38 Ill have 30 and 8	0
Because they are still the same boards and they are still the same triangle	0
Ian I need you to cap that marker	0
Im like Why are you disagreeing	0
My friends lets just connect the two desks	0
I need two helpers	0
Once I see it Im like Oh yeah	0
Now what I want you to do is I want you to multiply each section of the problem	0
Four times four is 16 plus three is 19	0
So wait	0
You guys can draw lines between the numbers to make sure that everything is lined up	0
No tricks  here	0
Thank you	0
Okay	0
So the decimal 0184 is read as 1 hundredth and 84 thousandths	0
Itd be 3 if we kept going and then 6	0
So what our vocabulary is is area model for multiplication	0
Lots of animals even humans  this	0
To me it looks like they multiplied	0
Instead of letting Haven pick her numbers Im going to let you pick them for her	0
Oops	0
Try really really hard to focus	0
So if you didnt hear what Mr Van said Van said that they are all rectangles and squares	0
How come	0
Not a function	0
Thats just a way that you have your model here but kind of showing your baskets and just having a picture might also show	0
You dont even need the whole thing	0
Were working in partnerships or on our own	0
This person gets one	0
So if I come back to my original example on the board here seven H and I said you worked two hours this week	0
The next thing you are going to do	0
one and two Alexander what are you working on right now	0
ATT	0
Its going to get smaller	0
Can I have some coffee	0
Okay	0
Because I know two and three fifths is bigger than one and two eighths	0
Sorry	0
So that means	0
Hold your answers to the camera for me	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
On Wednesday there was the link	0
Not yet but Im still on it	0
All right	0
No	0
All right guys	0
Heres what Im going to tell you Damien	0
I had two thirds shaded this way and two thirds shaded that way	0
Walter thats like the one you gave us which is a great idea because thats how I started too	0
Im anxious to hear some  answers to this hear what people have come up with	0
I say you say impractical	0
You went one extra step	0
one zero in my questions soI have one zero and my answer	0
Same with the math monster the body is where the math goes	0
Okay hold on	0
1078	0
Success criteria	0
I dont remember what absolute value was because I didnt write it down when you wrote it on the board	0
But for now were going to be focusing on lines line segments and rays and how we can use those to create angles and then eventually create polygons which are shapes	0
Sorry	0
Well come back to the part B in just a second	0
No	0
Yes	0
The rule is just telling you Oh you add one to all of your Xs	0
I know	0
Okay	0
One would match up with 65	0
Its important that you use that because thats where were going to kind of head today as we get into adding of fractions	0
Quick scenario this unit is about 50 math knowledge 50 internal motivation so Im going to be 50 mathTand 50 motivational speaker throughout this unit	0
Okay	0
Cause 7  cause  he was adding instead of multiplying	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
Im going to pull a stick for you	0
And hes like oh look what I just found	0
You are saying I totally got it wrong because you doubled all the coordinates instead of the first one	0
So youre thinking  that thats about twentyseven	0
Stay there	0
For either when we had them last night its in the black folder in the back	0
Yes yes	0
I know height dont know perimeter	0
Where this is the whole blue ribbon and  this now is that white ribbon ok and then you actually  divided up that white ribbon	0
Okay	0
One correct sentence	0
Okay	0
Lets take that piece back over there were going to go backwards	0
So we have same  rate here	0
Yes	0
Yes	0
Guess what 1856 is the answer to 58 times 32	0
Now that lets us know that our bottles are going to cost less than a dollar less than a one to one ratio	0
All right	0
Because we know the one and the six are the people in the yurt and timesing by 2 what	0
Okay we have to pay attention now	0
Calvin has his first two finished in the first one	0
It says label the number in the lower	0
Which is the	0
at all and Im going to write that over here	0
Draw it	0
From here to here is the square and from here to here is this triangle	0
It wouldve worked her pattern wouldve	0
So I think youre gonna get really close to your answer	0
Let Lucy finish explaining and then well move to you	0
These are going to be the cards that youre going to have	0
Well get to that in a minute	0
Back in the beginning nine two or nine three	0
Thats true for whole numbers as it is for fractions	0
What about a ruler	0
Try this again	0
Okay	0
In an effort not to scare although again	0
There wont be	0
Cause then	0
Youre making this harder than it needs to be and your decimals literally go	0
And I know that that s half of   and I know that yellow is half of orange which is ten	0
You are going to use greater than or less than to compare each fraction	0
Okay this is an image of a number sentence	0
I was just saying that	0
Oh okay	0
All right	0
No	0
Frankies mom drove 312 miles and use 12 gallons of gas	0
But make a ratio and a quantity and write down a story for that question	0
How did she get 25 over 100	0
Thank you	0
is six	0
All right	0
You re seeing a pattern here you re telling me	0
And go ahead	0
Thats very nice	0
Which is exactly what our objective is in this class	0
Okay	0
Youve got 600 numbers in your list in order from smallest number to biggest number	0
Its flat	0
Even if youre not sure I want to see some thinking	0
We would say for every two containers of strawberries you would pay 3	0
This time I want you to represent one third times three fifths	0
Can you see all right	0
Now Im sure you often hear probably on radio ads or or maybe even here at school	0
Please stand up and cover your nose	0
Lets say you move back a little bit so youre out of reach	0
Okay	0
And I added the 3 to the other 3 and then I added the 27 to the 3 that I got	0
Youre going to go  so you can take your period four code from my website and then youre going to go to the classroom and join the class	0
Not as  generous as Beth and Kimberly	0
What do you mean	0
This is the standard form and theres your exponential	0
And thats like your seasoning in there	0
So lets compare ratios	0
I know its not the new one	0
Thanks everyone	0
Yeah	0
Yes that doesnt matter	0
It might not be enough	0
Okay boards down	0
So we have Dallas	0
Friends hold on thats 12 x 23	0
Lets talk about the slope for this line	0
Whats happening	0
Number three last but not least	0
No 34  23	0
So Im going to take between zero and one and split it up into fourths so theres a half	0
If I have to pay an upfront cost of 20 that means if I send zero texts Im still paying them 20 just to be in the program	0
Totally	0
Okay	0
So their distance for both of them is  three miles	0
I know its a little bit tricky of a distinction there	0
Its not 17	0
The big kahuna	0
No its wrong	0
Give Owen a  clap	0
2 x 2 is 4	0
All right uncap your marker	0
You got it	0
And then your last one is one and 614ths and 914ths	0
Now it wants us to put in the new coordinates	0
Lets hear it	0
Four times	0
Remember the little apostrophe means thats the new shape	0
Solve on your whiteboards	0
I think it was two greens and a yellow but I m not sure	0
Okay hold on lets stop right here	0
Number one heres whatll make that more efficient  go through these and start the ones that you dont know already what the mistakes are	0
Three times 10 to the power of two times nine times 10 to the power of one	0
There s lots of hands up	0
Some people also saw that as rather than adding 20 20 20 you could just multiply by five instead	0
Okay	0
So you could have a bigger container if you needed	0
Please tell me you didnt change something because you heard other people	0
So you can do that	0
Well heres the other thing I know River	0
Make sure the one is under your four the 8 is under your five and the four should be in a place all by itself with nothing above it	0
That will give you a total of 34	0
theres a fire  in the area	0
Okay so I said so Zach said I needed to know what half of the denominator was	0
I have to go inaiudible	0
And then you do that plus adding the two and then subtract that from 181 and then you have A V C	0
There  are a some other people who are confused or arent sure	0
Were looking for the greatest dot and right here we can say Okay this is 14 and then were saying its in between 350 and 400 so halfway between this is a difference of 5000 so halfway between would be an addition of 2500 which we put in at 375	0
So anytime you do that and now they just do unlimited plans because I think plans like this existed more when texting was new	0
Okay	0
So we are going to go back to our knowledge that we learned toward the beginning of this school year on estimating and rounding	0
But instead lets talk a little bit about your homework for tonight	0
I just studied it last night	0
Good	0
I know the rule	0
There we go	0
All right	0
So lets return at 226	0
Like normal addition	0
Okay	0
I think that will make more sense for the second example that we give	0
We have little Jasper all the way to the Jasper that has eaten his mushroom and to running Jasper	0
Ill give you about two or three minutes on your own to finish	0
Remember the first one I gave you the x	0
Listen what I need you to do right now everyones going to get a sheet of paper	0
Right	0
We only ate one out of the 10	0
Yes	0
Meaning	0
In this first equation number one	0
When my denominators are the same I need to look at my numerators	0
The S is equal to minus nine	0
Just a minute	0
Lets look at this one	0
Yes you are working with partners at your table group	0
We have 30 minutes if you finish I am going to ask you to show me you are finished by separating from your partner and going back to work on math	0
Kase lets go	0
Yeah	0
I mean A	0
So go ahead and set up your body please	0
His pretty lame	0
Some of these might be review for some of you and some of them might be new	0
All of you look you all have to have matching answers	0
Maybe this isnt the best	0
Agree	0
When you think youve got it	0
Crosstalk	0
12 plus 12 equals 24 but if you buy one movie it equals 25	0
So lets think about it for a moment	0
Okay	0
All right	0
One	0
Well yeah	0
If youre sitting at table one please show me the same thing without using any rhombuses	0
There might be a very short quiz between now and then	0
So hell take a seat in the back of the room and I will send him those students that have the same assignments and they will discuss and check their work	0
A fourth teaspoon of salt	0
I wanted to thank you for sharing	0
All right	0
What I did is I did inauidble 3 whole times the three denominator and then I got nine and I did plus two	0
You should be ready to go	0
And that was a negative and you still need to put a letter in front of the axis	0
So now this one is	0
So you have seven shapes that youre graphing on here and each one you need the one before it to be perfect	0
The other partner needs to go to their student reference book and list the first six multiples of the number eight	0
Does anyone looks like were doing pretty well here	0
Im stuck	0
Then we colored over top of the twenty to make it only and then you just have to see how much would be left after you shaded it in	0
The only one I would really like you to do is to try this so if youre really not this is  I will need to try this okay if youre not going on this  Im going to be putting you with a partner and youre going to go through the same process where you both solved and then you check together and come to consensus so thats what were going to be doing today	0
So here I would take the six and divide it by three	0
So thats my hint for that one	0
And then since this box is grayed out you can actually just put like an X through it	0
Im persevering	0
Ah good observation	0
Archiel let me see yours	0
And then Miguel said I have to add the zeros	0
So you cant do it	0
It is a six because the place value to the right is close makes that number Look at this	0
I need three volunteers	0
Yes	0
So here comes the next one	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Now I would like for everybody to think about that	0
We need to get in the habit of doing this properly	0
The changing value is the slope	0
Thats why we do as youre doing here	0
Laughs	0
Sit down	0
I would eat 7000 pieces of candy Because	0
You seem thoroughly confused	0
Its just something fun for us to look at to help us remind us exactly how many of what there are in what	0
Lets talk quickly about the homework	0
I know the answer because fractions are my jam	0
Alan and I was sharing work and my number is wrong every single time	0
All right lets think about this rule here	0
Lets think about another array	0
Okay whiteboard should be up at your chest	0
If two angles of one triangle are congruentto angles of another triangle the triangles are similar	0
Okay	0
You missed a lesson yesterday so youre welcome to ask for a friends help	0
Anyway we might have had a different start and then we never would have seen nine here	0
Yes	0
You are using this to create the correct one	0
No	0
Okay	0
And Myles and Otto great starts Thomas want to be able to see your workas well	0
Okay	0
You just have to realize that its going to take you the full period to do the test	0
Now try labeling the numbers what numbers go where	0
If any of its wrong its all wrong	0
I see you in the chat	0
Example C So lets draw the triangle BHS	0
So Im going to fall a couple of sticks here	0
Good	0
I said five and a half pounds per day	0
You have your book	0
I do plus seven	0
Draw 38 circles	0
Come to the carpet please and you may close your book your math journal until were ready for it again	0
Okay now that is all were going to do for math today	0
Thank you	0
Proving identities is like a completely new style of math that youre not used to so please deal with the cognitive dissonance in your head in which you say This seems really weird and just allow it to soak in	0
And Im not going Oh thats a big thick line	0
Yes so you could do the fraction thats	0
So you get negative three over two	0
It doesnt matter	0
Okay	0
Okay so this is a hint for number five a lot of people were asking here and Im going to Im going to write same side interiors	0
Lets say I do it and I get for next seven	0
Which is forty out of one twentyeight	0
Can we do it this way	0
I hope you can find that note catcher	0
Subtract and I have 1 left over	0
Okay	0
And hopefully you can see that because negative two to four	0
Open your eyes	0
Love it	0
So the way that I knew that This is I want you to think about if I would have done that to make my six	0
Were going to use a lot of what we know about our benchmark fractions like our classmates helped us with when we first got on today	0
We investigate equivalent ratios a little bit last week when we looked at the KoolAid examples and we looked at if we had the same taste in KoolAid	0
Friends would you please take a minute and put your pencils down	0
Not eight divided by two	0
I revise all kinds of different things daily	0
Okay thats why	0
Otherwise you cant You might need the point tool Thats good	0
Is it 45	0
It should be 22	0
Did you pick up yesterdays homework	0
Right here Jack this is what your paper should have on it	0
Go	0
That makes feel good	0
All right	0
Its not letting me	0
Were going to	0
It does make sense I think	0
I flew like a fish	0
Because out of one half because you put three triangles on the rhombus	0
3 2 1	0
You guys once you understand what its asking you the tally marks are easy youre labeling them	0
See how much easier that is when you line things up	0
What	0
And I know youre hearing this a lot today	0
I also like to draw a number line here	0
I will see you guys later	0
So who will you send it to	0
Way to go	0
Then after you do the same problem	0
So were gonna start with the front side I want everybody to do the front side	0
I want you to think about what you should know to be able to solve this problem and youd probably need to draw a picture	0
Okay lets see	0
Fifth grade were going to take a commercial break	0
Yeah	0
7 12 7 14 Im going to put in between there 5 is going to come down here 7 34 7 12 and 7 34	0
So you divide that in half and get 55 degrees	0
Next	0
One unit by one unit	0
Right	0
Great	0
Sorry two different things	0
Three times four three times five	0
Im going to do 20 divided by 10 and thats two	0
OK	0
I have to see your best work and for some reason youre not doing that and Im not sure why	0
Great job	0
I got the first two	0
Well put the six over the edge there	0
No she said she said ones a pro surfboard ones just a beginner	0
This is one number that we have and we cant be mixing the two of them because we want them to stay proportionate	0
My eighths look like this	0
Divide	0
Im going to let the math guy read it	0
Yes you have to check your writing you need to  Its excellent	0
Um I think you are able to do the blue one	0
Im just lightly shading them in	0
It sounds like Piper bringing up the best strategy kind of brought it up out of everyones memory	0
You are also listening and understanding	0
And I have this they have this visual of like a rock hammer hitting the whole number and breaking it into chunks	0
Maybe	0
Least to greatest	0
Yes	0
A and C	0
Because somebody called him	0
I think was very similar to what David did or Finn not David	0
Okay so you circle what you think you ran it through	0
So it says you will need to draw these circles the best you can on a piece of paper	0
Heres what I would like for you to do	0
Dont forget to write your name	0
We know partial quotient and on Friday we got introduced to long division	0
If you reverse those you got it right	0
Hey Captainratspeopleout for someone who messes around with things as much as you do I dont think you should not rat other people out	0
Three bags of eight carrots means three times eight	0
So maybe we need to spend more time working on how to prove it	0
Stay standing	0
So I saw I think Dani you started by drawing these triangles and then you erased it	0
Youre a great person	0
Once you understand the problem you can play with the information which you can draw a picture diagram or other mathematical representation you can write a number model you can model the problem using objects such as counters or base 10 blocks	0
Now if I cut these in half One two three four five six	0
Okay	0
5 2 and then	0
All right	0
Think for just a minute	0
Forty	0
Grab like right here	0
Good	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Messing with you	0
Wow thats good to know	0
Will be greater than twothirds because youre multiplying the numerator to the nine and that will give you 18	0
Okay	0
Im going to go ahead and circle that	0
Okay	0
Negative two minus zero	0
What the problem Im seeing is You got the answer absolutely right	0
Id like to have a discussion because enough of you did  that and enough of you didnt do that and we had some  differences that Id like to discuss	0
Okay	0
All right	0
Look the two was correct but	0
You cannot see it very easily because at first they appear in different forms	0
Why dont you come over here to write on this side of the board	0
Im going to read it	0
Then I shaded these eight hundredths and	0
right	0
I want you to think about what our learning objective is today	0
There was 2 yellows on the bottom and 2 greens on the top and 2 on the top and 2 greens on the bottom	0
1 times two is two	0
Next step that I want to take are for you to go through On the next problem we have fill in the blank tick marks on the number lines	0
See how far you can go	0
So objectives for today same as yesterday but were gonna take it a step further	0
I dont know	0
Im sorry 11000	0
My sailboat looks the exact same as your sailboat	0
The creation of shapes	0
Only one that you cant see and they have 12 0	0
Circle	0
You mustnt start looking for others which please you	0
And I leave that one alone	0
And yes it does need to be in that order	0
Just like we did like the one half	0
sounds good Stephanie thank you	0
And I see a bunch of you typed those in already	0
Next one	0
The number of packages the number of cups and number of plates	0
once again youre not answering it	0
Youre going to have to move with Jermaine	0
What about the rest of it	0
Write down the answers that you came up with for fractions in fraction form for B on your paper	0
Go ahead and take a picture of it	0
The answer must contain	0
So success criteria	0
Youre sure	0
Its still not right	0
You need 42 cups of marinade and all	0
Okay	0
Sorry	0
And then multiply those together to get three halves	0
So lets go ahead and use a different color here	0
I dont see a picture on your paper	0
Try it out it should be written on the side of your pencil	0
Points	0
Okay	0
Just like you read a book	0
Or can I do four times H as well	0
We talked about for the algorithm we have to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number	0
Okay	0
And if you argue from there on you will figure it out as well	0
You go from 4 0 then you go up four  well you go four blocks north to 1 0	0
Okay and what this means F of three is this you take your F you dont have to write anything yet on this one	0
All right	0
So theres my seventh	0
Go ahead get your whiteboards out and your erase markers and stand up and push your chairs	0
Okay	0
If youve already done it and you agreed Problem number four is what I want you to Sorry Dwayne	0
If I ask you which is bigger a half or a third we  mean of the same object	0
The first thing that we need for a line plot is a horizontal line with an arrow point on each end	0
Open	0
These they dont match here and each one doesnt match	0
Matt you re doing two	0
Write down what I write down	0
So now Im going to display two more numbers	0
Okay	0
Eight divided by	0
Yes	0
Okay remember if you have noticed the difference if you have 12 you cant take 20 away from 12 you have to take 12 away from 20	0
inaudible	0
Okay go	0
Underneath each box she put Underneath the first box she put 6 and since 6 x 2  12 she put that underneath the second one and since 6 x 3  18 she put that underneath the third box and she put 24 underneath the last box because that is the whole number	0
The new trapezoid looks the way I expected	0
Im checking all of them but Im really looking at that one	0
Get some kind of sense into your head of what you did and then youre going to be comparing your thinking to someone elses	0
So the way you say it is zero and onetenth	0
Two and nine	0
Im going to give you a couple seconds to write this down	0
I saw six going at the top and then seven going down and I multiplied those two and I got 42 and then since theyre half dots they only count for half a dot I divided that by two and got 21	0
You could have made more than two but you made at least two  models	0
there you go	0
Your circle should have stayed the same	0
Or Yes sir someone wrote	0
Absolutely	0
They first shaded in blue for 25	0
Okay and we know if its the midpoint that means it splits it exactly in half	0
One looks good	0
Because now were in the land of multiplication is a variable sign symbol	0
Lets do one more set	0
Eh yes	0
How would two times make it go into four times	0
So did Lennox	0
So each x value has only one arrow so its always has to do with the domain if its a function or not	0
Okay	0
So you neShane to have all four corners	0
Yeah	0
That was 100000000000	0
As you solve these all you need to learn how to do is count zeros	0
And this is part of your study guide for this unit okay	0
Okay	0
Were you working with a partner	0
I turned it off	0
I will know I am successful when I can solve numbers stories with fractional answers and prove my answer with a tool or model	0
I uh brought the wrong notebook with me	0
Everyone sit down with the exception of Michael	0
So congruent triangles	0
So eight plus nine is 17 eight plus eight is 16 plus one more is 17	0
We are only going to work on Column 1A for right now	0
And then Im going to label that	0
Thats what Mr Alex just said	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Youre welcome	0
It seems like it was multiplied by 10 and was all calculated but	0
Okay	0
Blake same thing	0
From there so it goes down 1500 feet every time	0
So we were saying that we are building the largest fraction	0
Which benchmark fraction its closer to and its closer to two than it is to three	0
Okay	0
Yes they are	0
Sure	0
This one	0
And then we need to write our similarity statement	0
You got it	0
We are going to move one to surface area	0
Very good but you dont have to do this	0
Right	0
So you wrote it out	0
Well just this part is fine	0
All right guys	0
Let me go here	0
Once they come back well wrap up the graph and talk about it because it is really a good conversation	0
Calculate it and when youre done raise your hand so we can	0
Count them	0
Close your map journal	0
Yes	0
All right	0
And Im going to add two points onto this line one here and one here	0
I heard when you throw something away maybe add and subtract when you take something apart when something breaks down	0
You have an extra one	0
Okay so if youre kind of thinking Im going to show you in my video here but if youre thinking of an acute angle it can be anything from just barely more than zero like the thinnest angle ever all the way up to just before a perfect corner	0
On your marks get set go	0
When composite numbers have one and a double or more	0
Mmhmm	0
Hang on	0
Okay so were going youre doing parts of a set thats fine no you can do it that way	0
I  mean the color names	0
So theres 10 and then Im going to have 10 down below	0
So today our learning intention for lesson 38	0
Because like the equation that makes sense but it looks like a 90 degree angle	0
All right so and that will be the end of that	0
Or Xcoordinate ycoordinate	0
Very excited	0
Well I know the whole the numerator and denominator the same	0
Damian go ahead and write the problem down	0
10 to the third	0
Um what s bigger one half or one quarter and by how  much	0
Okay	0
Im wired	0
Thousandths	0
Yeah you should ask him about it	0
How does this	0
Okay	0
60 not 600 I dont have two zeros there Franc	0
Oh no no no no	0
Petra Paul come here	0
Madam but here  do we have to write the same things like here	0
Awesome	0
Then we got	0
People are a little confused	0
Yes	0
So we took one whole away and now we have three thirds	0
When your team is done with number one show me a zero	0
Okay	0
Isnt this	0
Okay	0
Thats how I have students do	0
Yes then you have to uh remove those angles or uh yes well thats how you get the small square	0
Well do question three next class	0
Showdown	0
Next time	0
Im just telling you	0
And when I say know your facts I dont mean know how to look at them here on my desk	0
You have about 10 seconds to be ready	0
So what we are going to do the first thing I am going to do is to show you how we created this ratio table	0
Go ahead and see what you can do	0
Yes	0
If we were in gym we would be catching the line	0
Okay	0
So I have one fifth and one half	0
Im going to ask you to write your name on your whiteboard when youre done	0
Your diagram might look something like that	0
Only if youd multiply it then itll get an E squared	0
Thanks Maggie	0
Awesome	0
They might they might not ask you  questions they might ask you a question instead	0
What page is it	0
So lets give you some things	0
Then you solve it	0
Arent they supposed to stay connected	0
connect those dots	0
Youll be able to see with that one	0
Okay	0
However what that 14 means is that this is half of one of the sizes of a piece	0
And then you are going to work on your homework	0
Theyre not telling us whats going in	0
Are we only doing	0
Okay	0
Grab one of them	0
Yes	0
So I did 14 divided by three which equals four remainder two and which I also know equals 4 and 23	0
I should see words	0
Okay and then eight divided by two equals the four remaining one I have to be able to divide to come up with then my divide my remainder	0
Common denominator is already found	0
And so whats the same about all of them the y value in all of them is just two	0
Taking the square root of all sides is going to happen at some point it just shouldnt be the first thing that you do	0
Do not turn in anything today because youre going to need it all Monday	0
Probably just turned off	0
If you feel all warmed up go for it	0
Thank you for sharing	0
Do not rush through it	0
So when you are writing your expression I would like you to think about division	0
Okay so	0
There are already enough in here you must not look for others	0
Okay I want to look at number two	0
You are going to work with a table partner	0
No use your head and your notes	0
I will be able to identify the slope and y intercept of a linear function from a slope intercept equation	0
Alright boys and girls	0
What number	0
Multiplying the numerators of the fraction gives the number of shaded parts in an area model and that is the numerator of the product	0
Let me look	0
Okay	0
It should look something like that	0
Think about this	0
Let me fix it	0
Okay	0
Thank you	0
Youve divided 15 by four thats 15 quarters	0
Okay	0
Excellent	0
The number on the top represents how many parts we are looking at	0
Okay	0
I had no idea you were going to Clayl	0
They cross exactly here in the middle	0
Now I get a highlighter	0
Round to the nearest hundredth	0
Okay	0
Oh if you only got one thats fine	0
9 10 11	0
I lied	0
Number 4 says count how many numbers in the set fall into each increment and make a bar that goes that high for each one	0
OK	0
No Im just asking	0
And the answer is yes	0
And then walk them through it	0
Mmhmm	0
We compared	0
I got that he had 10 pieces of fabric and 13 leftover	0
So go ahead and take out your packet to page 17 please	0
I have to be	0
Now I have one last problem for you to do	0
So weve got to multiply like it was 506 x 40	0
Six bags of 12 oranges	0
Voices are off	0
Okay	0
Complete that column	0
Two times or twice as	0
Unacceptable I cant let you go	0
And I know that I have four people you guys Im going to show you for those of you that are struggling with this Im going to show you an easy way to do this	0
And then we have trapezoids	0
No	0
Get your pencil ready	0
It was getting ready to die the other day	0
So Michael how or Adam	0
Where they are	0
Complete	0
I started with two fifths	0
Okay	0
They got that sheet back there with you	0
Heres what I need from you whiteboard marker	0
Alright come back to the shared screen lets do it	0
127	0
Were going to take that one step further	0
And then I want you to draw a line	0
Charlie turn your cameras on please	0
Todd you can move on	0
Where is there a difference in the place value	0
What are you saying	0
So this is the number were looking at to see if were going to let it rest or raise the score	0
So next time you have a family member go to the store ask them to see their receipts because depending on how your food is prepared the tax works differently which is kind of a cool thing about food	0
Okay you make a prediction first	0
Queen Ann wants her oldest daughter to have a half daughter number two to have a third daughter number three to have a third	0
I do	0
So lets make sure that we all hear the instructions	0
I had to draw	0
It just disconnected  again	0
Okay	0
Jessica said parts of a whole	0
Its right there right on the corner	0
I think that you do want to try to find secrets occasionally because that s that s sort of fun and that s what you do in science and and in mathematics but we also want to share them too and so we have to work out which we re doing	0
This is another possible person who had the same scores along the way	0
Yeah so every point on the Yaxis has zero for an Xvalue	0
I know	0
Ive got to plug in the	0
Oh you do not because I have your scissors so make sure that when they give them back to you we use them up for opening things	0
You are not getting the answer	0
I hope you actually learned five units	0
Come on you guys you learn better if you take some risks and talk about what you see	0
Lets see if our middle schoolers can do this	0
Thinking back to our objective I will know I m successful when I have aligned and solved these subtraction problems on Journal page 148	0
I added one	0
Im curious what that means	0
Okay	0
Yes youre right I told you guys to talk	0
So triangle l O M is N O	0
Okay	0
Two four five and seven and then answer this question	0
Ive heard about	0
So the one set of data you guys are thinking that this should be the X axis and this should be the Y axis	0
Okay	0
Can I just do this	0
So lets fill this in	0
There I know	0
So everything gets shifted over one place value	0
Okay hold on one second	0
Now as Im passing these back I want you guys to  okay so as were passing these back oh no  Smart Board okay	0
Im going to actually have you quietly go take your dryerase board back to your seats because theyre noisy and we pack and sit with them and youre going to come back and sit down	0
I wish we could go get milkshakes right now	0
In the two	0
Correct	0
Same citerior	0
10	0
Were going to start by	0
Um whoa no I lied	0
do that very nicely so half of six is three half of four is two	0
Thats the first way	0
She sold four tickets a day for one week	0
So what needs to go under my five	0
So crew make sure you have annotated your table	0
Next question	0
Then okay	0
Okay one two three show me your boards	0
No	0
From the sum of numbers two point four and five point six from the sum of numbers two point four and five point six well subtract subtract	0
What Im going to do is I am going to stop sharing	0
Take a seat SS please	0
Um what I was going  to ask you to think about um one of the problems a little bit  before we even shared and that was the problem that I think  everyone did work on uh the second one which was larger  three quarters or  two thirds	0
Okay	0
This is what you have	0
A tenth	0
For this one it would take me a while to think about whats the actual midpoint	0
You really should erase all these other ones because theyre just going to be confusing	0
So yeah	0
Well thats okay	0
This is a good example for those because M and E are your two variables	0
Thats funny you know	0
Whats going on	0
Okay	0
Okay here what I would like you to do	0
Friends thank you	0
Okay	0
Our answer is that its six times as long	0
Okay	0
And I need to go to page 30	0
We said next Tuesday	0
Okay	0
Remember how I said if theres nothing new youve learned	0
And its the same	0
Thats a great explanation Rylee	0
We can t come back tomorrow	0
That is something that my fifth grade friends meS up all the time	0
This is their fundraising thermometer	0
Okay	0
This is how we need to make sure to annotate our table	0
Um I remember that you wrote about the models that  you worked on and I I m looking forward to reading them  and um knowing more about they way you think about  them	0
If you divide one whole into fourths they have to have four of them to be one whole	0
For real my friends this is one of my favorite drinks	0
Youre going to make the order value bar graph	0
Sorry Im having a hard time tracking	0
Okay so now Im going to highlight those parts that are three on the same color so you can see this	0
Youre sitting straight up in your desks	0
You get to make the choice	0
It happened three times	0
Okay	0
Hold on youre sharing some really good information and I want to make sure everyone is listening	0
Were going to use the number that I came up with	0
That makes more sense	0
It might be easier to think in terms of circles and not rectangles	0
This was our product	0
Are we just going to use it whenever we look at it	0
Its the opposite reciprocal	0
Salt	0
56 is less than 70	0
Teresa what do you like to bake	0
And then Josh youre going to be with Ethan	0
You were saying or rather I encouraged you that you will pick two of your best friends and invite them to your Christmas dinner	0
Possible	0
Yeah	0
The first step is to make his head write down the problem	0
Im making sure I spell all of this right	0
And one of them is a representation card	0
Well we used we have the Pythagorean theorem	0
Were going to play fraction of and thats when youre done with each problem	0
Okay	0
Hes in the middle of doing it	0
Okay	0
So youre not going up by very much	0
Red	0
Fractions of the problem	0
So for the hotdog thing would the N be two	0
You were here you just turned off	0
Either they dont know how to add or I messed up on purpose	0
The four fifths	0
Exercise 11 B	0
Yeah	0
OK	0
So lets see on this model here we had an orange and a red  and then on that model there we have two orange and a  purple and in this orange here we have four orange and two  purple	0
I did not ask you to answer Clay s question	0
Hes a shopper	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Its really fun to hear you guys do all of that today	0
So heres the thing	0
Copy the table and fill it in	0
There is clearly something that we  are getting confused about	0
So the problem with that is Im going to write it over here	0
So far weve only had two types	0
So that means X equals 25	0
is not an answer	0
So hope class has been feeling quick to me today	0
cups of milk	0
Let me see where youre at	0
Easy question	0
So theres actually a few things mentioned in there	0
We already did some of these the other day and were going to do them again	0
Nice job Ethan	0
Come on Jonathan less time sharpening pencils more time working on fractions	0
Okay and I just want to make the point of this	0
Whole number A fraction is a whole number split into different pieces but the whole number is all the pieces together	0
Welcome back Frankie	0
134 page 134	0
Cause I think they should keep the 0  cause maybe the Student A would want to go to rent a DVD and they would find out that every month a DVD would be 12 um dollars for the Online Flix and	0
Everyones going to finish their work quietly and then were going to share	0
Half of 70	0
One two three show me your boards	0
The first one we might not remember how to do but we can use things like our room to help us figure it out	0
Because theres a lot of data points on there	0
Theres probably a better definition	0
All right now theres a small difference	0
And together just make a 180	0
Okay	0
Predict if its linear or not make a graph and then write an equation	0
Okay so weve got a OC got to read through the point	0
Okay or I can subtract	0
And in this problem you can see each domain value negative one matches to one zero matches to 3	0
Okay one two three on your whiteboards	0
Yes	0
And hopefully you remember from the other day you cant really cross over this vacant lot in the middle	0
There are four zeros in the dividend	0
We dont want to go down to 34 because thats not enough so we have to round up a little bit	0
Sixteen	0
Five four three two one	0
So Im not going to count that because it was heard before here	0
You must also speak quite clearly and loudly to the entire class	0
What about Austin and Gage	0
Jackson I already called on you	0
Good luck	0
Awesome	0
Happy Face	0
5 10 right there	0
Number four A and small A	0
And think about it in terms of your multiplication and your division rules of exponents	0
Thats the same as 15 times 15 or 15 of 15	0
Pull a tile out and show it to the class here s let s turn you around	0
Then I had to bring that four down in order to get my next number	0
Hm	0
You do not talk	0
Please show it to me	0
All right hold on just a second everyone	0
Yes it is	0
Okay	0
If you need to do the partition rectangle first and then you can write all the things youre multiplying	0
Thanks for coming in and getting started right away on your warmup	0
Yeah	0
And you are not caught up so you better continue working	0
Theyre equal to two	0
Okay	0
The seven the	0
Could be something like that	0
Plus five	0
Okay	0
I added up all the stories that hes planning to climb	0
Thank you	0
One	0
That is not a number story youve got to remember that your person has to be able to solve the question	0
It looks like a ramp	0
And for every 15 students	0
Number one you are doing the emperor penguin	0
And looking at our likelihood line does anybody want to take a shot at what number math mathematicians would use for unlikely to describe unlikely	0
The thing that I thought of that would force me to do that was to make all of your homework when possible fit on a half sheet of paper	0
Okay	0
They are onefourth	0
So Im going to be checking your number three problem on your page 93	0
Thats a great way if you have a fraction to make a quick graph	0
Right	0
type it in the chat	0
Thats awesome	0
So this is your scorecard	0
Everyone right now should be working on problem number four on the next page	0
Okay so were going to fill in our fifths and our tenths	0
Jesse can you grab the door for us please	0
Take mowed lawns to about a third of an hour on Saturday Saturday and one in three quarters hours on Sunday	0
Well try it again	0
You guys are going to keep working over here	0
You kind of got yours into words	0
You know those blinders one puts on horses all right	0
Good	0
Its the same	0
All right	0
So more of you did your Khan Academy which thank goodness	0
Uh I try to ask some someone to tell me what what you have uh read over for the uh last weekend	0
Good	0
So theres two fifths and then theres still the two	0
And Ms	0
If I gave you two numbers	0
So yeah Delta	0
Okay so Im seeing some awesome graphs	0
I want you to think about these	0
Im not looking for the answer	0
Alright everybody was able to do that just fine	0
Id like you to draw a table X Y going sideways table	0
These are the calculations of your data but youre putting these to get your	0
One	0
Theres another one out there another diagram it could be	0
Okay here we go	0
Page onefourfour	0
Inside there were 34 of a pizza	0
This is a number	0
Oh my gosh	0
Goodbye Dan	0
You should try to use	0
Now we just got to get you to say it right	0
One persons going to roll the dice	0
Okay	0
And then this right here is your y intercept for this problem which is negative two so you could say 4x minus two and Id like you to write that in if you dont have that	0
Be prepared to explain your answer	0
Agree	0
The first thing I heard you say was that you know you could multiply the denominators	0
Except Christian	0
Okay	0
All right	0
On here Im going to go to six bars	0
Weve go enough	0
When were looking at these fraction addition multiplication not multiplication subtraction problems you have your benchmark fractions to choose from so you are going to choose what benchmark fraction these addition and subtraction problems are going to be closest to without solving	0
Thank you Rory	0
Right	0
Okay	0
Yes yes thats fine	0
All right good	0
Okay so those of you that are good with this go dont leave the meeting just mute me and go turn your cameras off	0
Oh	0
Get the seven and eighth pieces of data add them together and	0
How do you feel about that class	0
You are going to draw connect those points	0
We should say this is a common factor three but we three divide by three	0
Were going to do our fours this time	0
Not at all	0
Your name might be called to what Parker just said so you need to be actively listening and looking at him	0
Six in sevenhundred and eighty five thousandths is greater than six in seventy nine hundredths	0
So two one right there	0
And I want to thank you	0
Yes so it answers my question	0
So now lucky you you guys get to use the opposite which you guys will enjoy	0
If you only have fractions  parts	0
Anybody who wants to say it becomes a mathematical expression like this	0
Sorry	0
We were right okay	0
See what we got	0
Thinking	0
Fifth period	0
Rebecca you are doing 25 of 81	0
One two three show me your boards	0
Come up front and Okay	0
I know area	0
So we basically had Ella has 22 baby carrots	0
Where are they  Oh well	0
Yeah	0
So three and 482 thousandths	0
Its just a comparison of two things rather than fractions theyre like a parttoa whole relationship	0
And I know that five eighths is closer to four eighths	0
Amazing	0
Alex dont worry about the camera lets worry about math	0
So a segment bisector could be point B	0
116 times 4 is 464	0
No	0
See you then  get back	0
Surface area equals four Pi	0
What if I told you there was a line under all this and the student wrote  6 chocolates  and put a big box around it	0
Okay so now we are going to go to the next one and it should be the one that I am hoping it is	0
Friends if you need to move just go back to these table	0
Lets get a common denominator here	0
We are going to say this together when I get to three	0
Mmhmm	0
In the 2012 Summer Olympics American American swimmer Missy Franklin won the 100 meter backstroke the times of the top two winners were 5868 and 5833 seconds which was a winning time	0
What they do is some people show all their work which is great but some people just write down the equation and their answer	0
So theres a lot of different ways you can approach this	0
When the bottom wins it always has horizontal asymptote at Y0 and the graph looks like this	0
Okay	0
And then we moved into some fraction division	0
Okay	0
Madam	0
Yes	0
Do you want	0
It looks like my smart board may have frozen	0
There you go	0
Oh are we	0
Now I have seven tenths now I need to subtract 39 hundredths so Im going to start with the three	0
Zero	0
That gives me x is equal to 15	0
All I did was multiply multiply my two denominators together	0
No youd have 30 total squares but	0
So thats my estimate	0
The root of the number	0
I didnt mean to	0
We can figure that out	0
I told you to plot these	0
Ill fix that	0
This is where were going to start really doing some thinking	0
So what we just did is if we know that these two points are a reflection of each other we figured out what is the line of reflection	0
We also saw it looks the same but bigger	0
Yes but Mrs Reevess are on the top this time	0
No its not its seven	0
Go ahead and start with number one	0
Yeah absolutely	0
So I have to come up with something thats going to get me closest to it	0
Okay	0
The uh the H seven H and then the four where do you get the four Ws to	0
Our next one says use the area model to find the product	0
They did not spend 5000 on that day	0
Bella is ready	0
Well lets see if he is right by filling in P equals one P equals six	0
So todays goals	0
Okay	0
Have you ever been to my website	0
All right	0
And then I just want you to notice so like this point down here I need the writing tool	0
I Im pulling it up on the board	0
Okay so your table helped you out a little bit	0
So should I come up	0
Call up the next student	0
MItchell	0
Lets simplify these and combine like terms and see what we get	0
Okay	0
Were already almost halfway through	0
Okay here we go	0
Look how many times 12 has been open or closed now	0
Thank you James	0
I also want you to put the dashed line in here	0
So you do it by half	0
Im going to  whos your partner	0
People will if you were to say that in a room people would know would you meant by saying 25 or 25	0
Yes	0
Sixtwelfths which is a half so 11 and a half	0
Okay	0
Im going to real quick on estimating	0
Nah I could	0
So seven yerts can accommodate 42 people	0
It is possible very good	0
I think it helps we can show it	0
Seven	0
Yep	0
I need to check the rules before I can continue on	0
Both answers are correct	0
Wow a lot harder than I thought to write in there	0
Now when I go to the next past the decimal I know that Ive gone into the tenths with the ths hundreds with the ths and 1000s with the ths so it would be 29 hundredths	0
It says Jake mowed lawns about one third of an hour on Saturday and one and three fourths hour on Sunday	0
How do you do it	0
Whoa	0
We have four in the tenths just like you said and we have seven hundredths just like you said and in total that equals 47 hundredths which is also what Stella said	0
If we replace x and y so x is four and y is one	0
It doesnt look one to me and neither does that one	0
James says Well lets take what he wants minus what he has and we got 60	0
Thank you	0
All right	0
Mark it into the sketch	0
Okay can you guys turn that way	0
Real world situations	0
This one could be a little more closer to zero	0
Yeah	0
Would you do me a huge favor when someone in the office has a minute bring me down a paper mask for a student I can not get this child for the life of me to wash his mask first of all and then its below his nose	0
I want to make fourninths and Im telling you I just want to add oneninth plus oneninth plus oneninth plus oneninth and Im telling you that that equals fourninths	0
Okay so we did get 12 plus  is 910	0
Yes so we have zero and three there	0
All youre gonna do is point	0
The ones that you cheat off of	0
I love that because that is really why we cant add them up but they have different denominators	0
This one is on the top side	0
Were gonna do one more review question then were gonna move on to our next topic	0
Its like a glorified tent a very glorified tent	0
Agree	0
Thanks welcome	0
Okay	0
Heres a big hint	0
You need to attract one to get your answer for the	0
We knew that	0
Notice Im not getting anything with that five yet Im only talking about the 82 only talking about the 82	0
Hold your whiteboards up	0
Did you find one	0
Thats right huh	0
Number five where I asked you to compare your prediction	0
Lets do this by 10 now	0
You dont need to write that word down	0
So Ive had to take the three and make it  two	0
Margaret check sentence five	0
Not yet were not going to write anything yet but just have one ready	0
And diagonals are a little bit more tricky I would say	0
Think about it you don t have to do  that one	0
So the thing that helped us decide to add was all of those in the parentheses we have to add up	0
only wearing this really thin thing	0
Okay	0
I love it	0
Im going to split it up into two numbers	0
Wait	0
I saw some people talking about why	0
See what we can come up with for this one	0
Theyve already figured it out for us but were going to do it together	0
Okay	0
And CPR article education will help people city people understand the benefits of tap water	0
Youre doing exactly what I need you to do	0
Okay	0
Its the biggest word that I say based on this video is mmhmm	0
Yes	0
These numbers on the outside of our box are our partial quotients	0
Okay all right so youve got your numbers	0
I forgot the bottom part	0
Um it is multiplication TopIt large digit larger numbers	0
And seven to the third power	0
So what you did is realize Oh well they added a shole to that two which made it a seven fifth	0
And thats a  different pattern	0
Let me put this up	0
The equation of A is four minus three X equals Y	0
So youre wanting me	0
All right	0
He packs as many full cartons as he can	0
Right	0
Now Im going to show you some examples	0
And I think as youre taking the quiz today as youre working on problems like this its just so important to start with the y intercept	0
Okay	0
To one other problem	0
Okay	0
Just to the restroom	0
Yeah	0
I have two numbers here	0
Well do number of cups and then well do number of plates	0
That would be a fourth	0
You need to be able to explain from where youre at	0
All right but youre missing something	0
A pint is half of a quart	0
Hey Debbie can you look at sentence two	0
Because half of nine is  it should be higher than twothirds because nine is an odd number and because its not even that means that there will be another fraction added onto the nine	0
Were going to use this one to create an equivalent fraction for two eighths	0
Okay close	0
Yes	0
I love that John just turned his chair around	0
Moreso every problem has that amount of work	0
I have your quizzes to turn back to	0
You only had to do two from each row	0
Eleventhirds	0
Same with this one	0
So were looking at four	0
Now I need to add in That takes care of this one and this one	0
Get 40 students	0
You got that one	0
Also think about your multipliers in the table	0
Okay	0
The example is that we have the original size here and enlarged is a lot bigger	0
Last question please read it	0
You guys arent telling me to stop forcefully enough for my taste	0
Down here for the green one Ill move my cursor so you can see	0
Okay	0
Its okay youre thinking	0
All right put an answer down in five four three two one showdown	0
Yes	0
So youre doing page 55 and math boxes on page 66	0
Table chart	0
How loud he talks at your house	0
Oh great	0
And the last thing were going to do is 10 ounces of a can of cream of chicken soup	0
Dwayne Im asking you not to solve the problem	0
No youre not obliged to no youre not obliged	0
From here my class should all know that the thing that we always start with in the thinking box is the divisor	0
Okay	0
So hes right	0
The nine the seven and the	0
Yeah	0
Beeswax Shea butter almond oil and flavoring	0
I borrow from the 3	0
If I multiply 300ths times seven tenths	0
Just work on the next one go ahead	0
Matching cards	0
You cant you know no more places to put them	0
Larger than 90 degrees	0
If I go backwards its   2	0
Yeah	0
Who were you talking to	0
okay	0
Is your fraction you grow in part with A to write three fractions youre going to	0
If you put those two wholes together so then it makes one whole	0
Your answer for that one would be one and onethird	0
Elijah	0
Trade me	0
Fine	0
Thats a half an hour	0
When you are done with your homework and I have given it to you your job is to play fraction	0
I was right do you see	0
So if you notice mines in four	0
Just do this one really quickly	0
Find the mistake	0
That was very helpful	0
So in this case my number five is worth 50 because its in the 10s	0
And the 4 that was in the 1s place is in the tenths place	0
Yes	0
It could be done this way	0
It would look like this	0
So you could do that	0
Lets check it	0
Well Michael does the binary and we do it but just with the H and the A	0
So  says we need one important piece of information in order to solve this problem	0
And itll make it so that you have more work time and less listening time today	0
Cooking is more stuff on the stove and baking is the oven	0
Bella help her out	0
Okay so we answered the question	0
If you wrote it tiny or if you have your name tag thats fine	0
The same	0
Ten	0
You got the little devil on your shoulder and a little angel on your shoulder	0
Considering you know that the whole rectangle because you said its six times eight	0
You dont need to write down anything yet and were going to investigate this a little bit	0
T your cameras kind of shaking	0
Whoops	0
Did you	0
Yeah	0
Cool	0
Put speed in your back pocket and go with accuracy and speed will come	0
I want to tell you the truth but I want to tell you the truth set and I want you to tell what the equation is here	0
My God	0
That tells me that you chose the wrong partner because you spent more time talking than you did working	0
You guys I see that there is some confusion about what an estimate is	0
Thats the tradeoff	0
Its on already sorry	0
You could figure out what 40 off is or you could also figure out how much youre going to pay what percentage are you going to pay	0
Well if you put all of them up  there would be ten wholes but	0
Right	0
Yes	0
Youre right	0
Lets just look at number five	0
But then you go through a block	0
All right girls you may go	0
Its the B in the equation	0
How about double each number of the originals	0
Okay so now we have Ryan live three to four miles from school	0
Okay	0
Ms Lancour should we solve it	0
Uh could it also be that you only get this number	0
I talk nice to it	0
Yes turn it into a fraction	0
Myles you need to  match or else you are going make a mess too	0
All right	0
An eraser	0
Gentlemen show me that you can find the right page in the	0
Okay turn towards me	0
Okay	0
Laurie already explained why we find a common denominator	0
If both of them are positive numbers and we want to eliminate the X	0
Lefthand arrow bringing your cursor back to L one	0
I know youre doing it right but I want to see all your work because as you get into more complicated stuff you want to be able to show me what you did on all of them	0
Were going to take Zoeys example build a garden that is twice as large as the first they are as the other one	0
Okay	0
Look at your picture	0
So the square of A equals 64	0
Mines not going to look perfectly like a rhombus but it actually is	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
So I actually had two strategies	0
All right	0
Okay lets talk about your problem	0
Get ready	0
Okay now Im going to divide these	0
Check your answer	0
Im going to have you go ahead and read that with me	0
Connect the points in the same order that you plot them so its just like the sailboat	0
How much oil should you use to make a total of 28 teaspoons of dressing	0
Estimate the sum of 12 plus 13 and then solve	0
I already showed mine	0
Transform pentagons into triangles	0
So nine divided by three is three	0
So we really want to make sure were feeling good about it for this one	0
Otherwise I cannot mark you as present today	0
Crew we are going to pick up on this tomorrow	0
Who else does not have fraction circles	0
Look at the data	0
Okay all right	0
This isnt Im seating at my desk and Im just going to do my work and Im not going to pay attention to anybody else	0
No because all of them are zero	0
Wed have a microwave	0
But now the total isnt eight anymore	0
It says Robbie says the area	0
I still dont understand G eight	0
Eve I like your enthusiastic  attention	0
Later Ill figure it out	0
Thats what Im about to do	0
Totally people	0
All right people	0
Right good	0
Three	0
You will have a with a partner and compare how you solve the problem	0
Now Hadley is going to do three times 90	0
So same deal	0
The first thing were gonna look at is what kind of angles that were gonna be talking about today	0
Yes	0
Um so while were gone and the other  mathematics youre doing with Mrs Phillips I hope youll  continue to write to me about what youre doing and to Dr  Martino so we sort of can still feel close to whats going on  when were not here	0
They come every summer	0
Its 40	0
I I understand	0
Ok great	0
Okay thanks for letting me know Leanna and Cody	0
Yes but I want you to write the fraction threefourths without using the number three	0
Id love to see some work written down on paper	0
Oh wait	0
It does well it does make mathematical sense but it doesnt follow the plan	0
To already use the	0
Just 11 P	0
Yes	0
Thats not gonna help me	0
Okay	0
If he gets it right Im going to say Brandon you did a great great great great great job	0
So now Im going to ask you how to present problem two A the number 15	0
Oh maybe you could use my pencil and then mark it	0
I gave all my pens away	0
She likes twelve	0
Great	0
Whoevers got it just give it to me	0
And then well be able to represent linear functions using tables graphs and equations	0
Okay	0
But you I though you asked me is it the same as this	0
Those	0
No	0
Okay	0
I think its called quintupling the amount	0
But its going up	0
Give me an agree sign if you thought about the arithmetic strategy	0
Square feet	0
Five four three two one	0
In a moment I will explain something about calculating variables	0
Five four three two   one	0
Yeah Olivia helped you out with that part	0
Green	0
Were going to break them up into equal groups which is something you can look for when you were doing a problem that has common factors	0
yes	0
Okay	0
If this is posted on the website you guys can have some extra help with that	0
Wow that took some	0
Your coordinates still are not right because can I borrow your paper for a second	0
Remember it doesnt have to be perfect	0
Onetwelfth is the smallest fraction	0
Think about E	0
Yes	0
But you have to make a combination with that number	0
Exactly	0
No it doesnt say	0
Two sentences something that is the same and something that is different	0
Sure	0
And well talk about that first	0
Oh nice job Sir for knowing that	0
Yeah	0
Okay so those are all our test topics	0
Because theyre right here they can do it together	0
and at the same time I do minus five	0
Okay	0
This problem would tell  me how many days in 9855 years	0
One at  a time	0
I want to hear you talking	0
I would just set it all up in one	0
Okay	0
Yeah but since I said go not Amy Lynn	0
So you guys know how to define it when it comes to these forms	0
Okay	0
Give them horns	0
We know our answer is between one and two	0
Yeah	0
Yeah	0
PAMPs due Friday	0
Work it out together	0
On page 52 I need you guys to circle problems 45 and six	0
Well I have a five I have a three	0
That makes a lot of sense to me	0
Yes though its 28 29 it is correct	0
It takes four times that amount to fly from Chicago to Buenos Aires Argentina	0
I want you to say how many dots you saw and then explain how you saw them	0
Lauren Im going to let you draw a picture and see if you can figure that out	0
So when I take these twoeighths and I turn them into fourths I dont have two anymore I have one piece	0
Correct	0
Im going to pull some scripts to help me	0
The average value of the price its in euros but this was 80000	0
I see in the word form that  and he didnt quite put the 37 in word form	0
Because 13 of 24 is 8 and then 23 is 16 because 3 x 8 is 24	0
Were moving it to the right	0
We had talked about six pieces here so flip those because I think thats what you meant	0
Im tugging at your brain	0
You are going to explore the results of multiplying fractions by fractions equivalent to one	0
Oh we forgot to label this stuff	0
So lets go up to the first one	0
Two different ways	0
Thank you	0
Six five	0
You start with a picture	0
Yes you may use anything you need as a reference friend	0
You can scale these up differently	0
Okay	0
Got it	0
14 of the needs are blue	0
Remember  this is called fifty the orange	0
Youre good to go	0
Minus one squared	0
Okay so heres our next one Im going to do much less talking for this part because I think were probably getting the hang of it a little bit	0
Yeah	0
That was a good review	0
S Because we might have pulled out one green two times out so we might stuff like that	0
All right I wanna talk about what Annabelle almost did	0
Let s see	0
Yeah	0
I Mr Parker solve number four and then Laurie Mr Parker come solve it her way and well see whos right and whos got a better answer	0
Were going to circle groups of one eighth	0
Youre interpolating an answer	0
Okay	0
Because like if Im in second grade Im like I dont even know	0
Now we wouldn t solve it today it s a very hard problem	0
So if we wanted to just do threefourths wed just do onefourth onefourth onefourth and wed keep out this last fourth and that would give us threefourths	0
Right	0
Now you have 23 or 23 x 3  8  1	0
Oh nice	0
Group five	0
Because 4 times 10 is 40 and 24 times 10 is 240	0
Were going to do histograms	0
Nice job	0
Yeah thats what we got two this would be the whole and that  would be the half and that would be the third	0
I am going to push two more questions out to everybody and we will go from there	0
Go	0
Keep your cameras on	0
I heard Seth say that six we should use as our common denominator so I did	0
Yeah	0
In my math bin	0
We are trying to to find the sum of these two decimals	0
Number five but do those directions umber six do the book directions	0
I made that also	0
This is huge people all the time want to also put a graph right there you cant do that youd fail the vertical line test	0
Okay so I wanted to review the problem with you	0
So on the whiteboard for mental math warmup I would like you	0
Ok you think it makes sense but you re just kind of  checking it	0
I think you will enjoy it	0
Its alternate	0
Okay	0
Thats important because without understanding our timeframe thats like saying Okay	0
Okay so if you have one more box so you have two right here	0
All right	0
Put that in your desk	0
Lets go	0
I know that if I multiply this by four I can get close to that value that I need	0
Two of these	0
Uh you may yes you just have to hurry you just have to get here fast	0
Make it larger	0
Okay	0
She has a dilemma	0
Done	0
Yes	0
Ten to twenty	0
Now I noticed I have to do another step before I subtract	0
Okay number two	0
So I want to show this persons work because I think this is a great example of plugging in the number	0
Is it mandatory	0
Why did I get it wrong oh I didnt write it	0
What	0
You dont need to	0
So Im going to go and make that be a 3x What the heck thatd be a 3x	0
Thats wonderful	0
So lets start by looking at eight and 12	0
Today by changing this condition by changing this condition	0
Does it matter which one you substitute	0
Lets do eight to three and this time I want to divide 66 dollars	0
smores but they exploded all over the microwave	0
Good job	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
If you did it with one of those circles and you did nine for each you will have to color in three for 39 and then for 49 you will have to color four and youre going to get four for 49 and three for 39	0
So when we talked earlier this week  weve been talking about things weve been doing since we were five	0
So you start to make your way towards the store from your car	0
These are the game boards	0
Christian  give us a box number	0
Do I change it with this one accidentally	0
So	0
Alright may I borrow your whiteboard very quickly and then one of yours	0
Okay	0
Me	0
So correct	0
Youre going to	0
Who wants to be next here	0
So I need you to estimate these	0
All right so I have 13 23	0
I would like you to make sure youre getting the aim	0
Myles I need to click the link please	0
You could but	0
Let s unravel it	0
And so I have seventeen so it s not zero	0
We are converting pints into cups	0
You have to look at the directions	0
Now	0
It takes three hours to fly from Chicago to Canada	0
Is it correct	0
So I think that is why she  did it	0
Exactly	0
OK	0
Yeah its a way that you can think about it as well	0
Im impressed	0
When youre done you may get your no no	0
First of all thank you everybody for been super patient today and working really hard on this	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
I had Maggie	0
How many will Gary and Jack get	0
Lets go to the next one	0
Yes	0
And then youre going to label them	0
Okay	0
Could you do four blocks north and then six blocks east	0
If you both agree youre going to finish what you can on this page	0
Remember that s where you turn on the truth testers	0
So this becomes one comma something	0
Think Saurabh	0
This point is on the Yaxis so its zero comma six	0
If you dont understand it you need to see me but you can check your answers with a partner	0
Okay	0
You dont need to type that youre confused in the chat try on the problem and then pay attention and Ill help you	0
So its really these in between points but you can find it by comparing these two points here	0
They need to  get us  working ones	0
So if we look at this in total this brownie pan has been divided into 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 by 1 2 3 4	0
So were going to draw another pan of brownies here	0
Okay	0
So erase number eight	0
Oh thank god	0
Thats what youre gonna work on for the next 13 minutes	0
You know how to divide	0
Oh	0
I think Ill put up a couple of review games for multiplication when youre finished of choices	0
But  you could put the third in any one of those but they are all  the same length each so they still have the same fraction  value of one third	0
We can also say 28 divided by five	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Comparing ratios	0
We get eight	0
Then he drew it	0
Okay	0
Im just confused on how you got 24	0
Everyone return to your seats and please go ahead and warm up	0
Im going to hear what you say in a few minutes	0
Okay	0
I need to update my attendance	0
Because if youre not you  may want to go up and count them to be sure or go to  someone else who built the model and count them	0
And so if we look here each one of these xs is fine I know what happens to each one of them its totally okay that putting a one in gives me a four and putting a three and gives me a four thats legal	0
I just put an E at the end of your name	0
Write them on here	0
Haley I dont think you were dismissed from our group yet	0
Length times width	0
Two is just too easy	0
You need to be engaged in this work	0
Walk to people	0
Right tell me about them	0
At the top of your lab sheet even if its not taped in yet I want you to write ordered value bar graph	0
Yes your dotted lines	0
Okay so you guys are plotting these coordinates first column with the original sailboat right here	0
They glide out of the water but they dont fly	0
Can I fetch my books for a second	0
I just want them to notice	0
So do you make the first number bigger then the xaxis will be a big part in that	0
Okay	0
Shhh	0
Less than or equal to 2100	0
And today we wont change the parallel lines	0
And the 10s place was counting up zero one two three four	0
I think most of you have this correct	0
Because that is absolutely right	0
Okay Im going to leave you alone	0
So lets start off with this	0
I just told you	0
Write an equation	0
I need to see you actually writing the decimal not just the answer	0
There you go	0
We have a relationship that is red to blue	0
It looks like	0
I like that	0
Here is the more simpler version where you get to just bring it all together	0
So you might just start at 20 and go up to 45	0
Yes	0
So I dont know if youve seen the Chronos Extreme covers basically you just need an extreme cover	0
Thank you	0
Now Im going to see if you can figure out the rest of the equation	0
30 seconds go get get it get in	0
Whos ever watched wrestling been to a wrestling match any of that stuff	0
Oh yeah	0
Page oneoseven	0
I want you to be thinking about a rule	0
therere more dynamics to do this buddy	0
Okay all right	0
So on your we we had just gone over the learning intention and success criteria	0
My game is that you pick a stick and whoevers name lands on it types to you in the chat for the question and then we try to solve it	0
Okay	0
Table two please take away 500 points	0
Five four three two one zero	0
Jade says 45	0
Number three on your own	0
I said whats the square footage that were covering	0
This is way way way in the future	0
The first thing is lets talk about the homework for tonight and what it actually is	0
The pizzeria because we already said he is 9 blocks from the movie theater but then hes 7 blocks from the boat rental and six blocks from the gas station	0
So this picture could just as easily be this might not be drawn to scale	0
Pass this to Alice	0
Okay so I would like for Julia explain your reasoning behind this to me please	0
Be specific in your description	0
Oh theyll figure it out	0
What in reality was happening was my whole wasnt one sheet of tissue	0
Ohhhhhhh	0
Okay your graph looks like this kind of shaped like a V Okay your domain	0
Theyre different	0
Okay	0
because they give you a couple examples at the top	0
First I did this then I did that	0
All right	0
Asher you can just work with the girls	0
I used traditional US	0
Yeah thats what hes saying	0
Dont do anything right now	0
The person with the short hair is going to use my thinking is similar different or to add	0
Okay nice job	0
Hudsona that one looks good	0
Then you go to add class	0
The estimation was we knew that the benchmarks were fractions one half and one because 11 twelfths is closer to one and 612ths equals a half	0
Show me	0
And we are in Unit 7 and were going to continue through Unit 7	0
And so the opposite of zero is either undefined or you could even say infinity if you want	0
Okay four divided by 10	0
If I have 9284 calories and I divide that over 13 days thats 714 hours a day	0
How much oil should you use to make a total of 28 teaspoons of dressing	0
So a circle is like a two dimensional thing where you have a center and then its all the points around there	0
And weve got two more to go	0
The first hint is this	0
So now weve got a good start	0
He has one	0
Its like when you have a sub or when you go to specials	0
The reason probably is These ones these ones are rounded off slightly	0
Good perfect	0
Okay	0
Okay heres our fruit bar	0
Hold on youre done	0
Oh so just	0
But I want to see what you think the answer is	0
Nice job thank you	0
You and your partner need to decide whos player one whos player two	0
But we just choose one direction	0
So guys if you dont understand watch	0
Ive also got more rods up there	0
It could separate 8751 and if you took away the decimal point it could change it to 8751	0
You stay standing until Im done calling names	0
Were going to write what Herve said then were going to look at how we can complicate a problem which wasnt too complicated to start with	0
Interesting	0
Going to	0
I think maybe Jeff was talking about it a few minutes ago	0
That is correct	0
So that one is perfect	0
You have no idea what Im talking about because you were staring at that wall back there for some strange reason	0
Do what its asking you to do	0
Nice and loud	0
But look blue redblueredblueredbluered	0
This is where you make the team	0
I m shaking the bag	0
So lets say they give you wow they give you twofifths and they say Okay I want a denominator of 30	0
No	0
I didnt think of it	0
We will do all three methods on the board and then from there you guys do your work	0
Hold up with your fingers how you feel today before I even taught anything	0
Now Im 12 away	0
You add a half to onefourth you get threefourths	0
You can take a seat	0
So the surface area of a sphere is this four Pi R squared	0
That s interesting	0
To start you are going to write decimals in standard notation and in words on your slates	0
So value is important to know	0
All right Royce	0
I have a lot of empty whiteboards	0
Today its going to be really difficult to do it on your own	0
Okay	0
And that	0
The surface area of the square	0
Okay have a seat	0
All right	0
First of all lets check out how it works	0
14 of the fruit bar	0
Because this one the one I explained wont be explained until the next paragraph	0
Dont spend like  get to spend like	0
Use this strategy to do four on 167 and Im going to come around and check you out to see if you are ready to move forward	0
Okay	0
He mixes the batter and pours it into two small bread tins	0
I like how youre problem solving	0
Write it down	0
Oh  too	0
He just now said it	0
Heres the twist	0
No he is working on 14	0
Yes	0
Um mm	0
Yeah	0
So Im going to start by dividing this into tenths	0
Now you are going to watch the rest of this video	0
We can just write not similar for this one	0
Im not even going to touch	0
If there isnt an angle here it cant be understood	0
So keep going	0
Lets say Lyle goes one meter per second faster now hes going two meters per second	0
And I added a couple things on this slide	0
That piece of paper was	0
Are table groups sought	0
I will check it for you and I have a whole book	0
Excellent	0
You started at eight	0
You guys are adjacent to each other	0
Okay	0
OK	0
You are going to play this for 20 minutes	0
All right	0
Okay Im going to give you an opportunity to turn and talk to your neighbors on the floor and I am hoping that this is going to work	0
Ill come pick those up	0
One thing I want to make sure  Im ready	0
All right	0
That is the weirdest thing	0
Okay	0
We have 10 plus 7 plus 9 I would say that around if you have a number around 26 for your total	0
You cant hear it in MathLand	0
Im sorry for that	0
What I want you to do in your little teams right now is take maybe five minutes	0
Because we know that 5000 isnt near enough zeros	0
It is whatever is directly to the right of the ones in every number	0
When we talked about side angle side side angle side the angle is in between the two sides	0
All were doing is substituting in  number names for these color names at this  point	0
And they are going to be supplementary but for a slightly different reason than we maybe have seen before	0
You do here the thing like this you can say Im doing literal calculation	0
And then this one is showing the same thing just in a different format two matches up with four and two matches up with five	0
And hopefully that would have been flashing red lights in your brain saying Hmm I dont think so	0
And were going to keep cranking through page 22	0
You cant solve this	0
Would be the smallest	0
All right	0
I want you to think about this turn and talk to your neighbor about what kind of angle this gives you a clue about	0
Because the	0
There you go	0
To do one 30th of 2400 you would divide 2400 by 30 and that would give you about 80	0
Thats your y intercept	0
This part shows the points we started with	0
I  use to when my son was your age he use to think about those things	0
Nice job	0
There you go	0
I actually got a different way from one person that I w just really wasnt expecting	0
Its quite a lot wider eh	0
And the reason its going to be messed up is	0
Colins got a good start	0
we know were too high	0
But good point Pedro	0
It just means find the opposite of it	0
Ms Douglas when you said Shut it down for a second I thought something was going to happen	0
Jonathan can I get you back up to do some more recording for me	0
Okay Mia what are you doing	0
For this homework were going to go a little bit quickly through the beginning part and then were going to spend a little bit more time on question ten on the back and then well go into our activity for today	0
Then theres a lot of points we can grab on this one as well	0
Please stack the chair	0
I said on day six	0
Its so crazy isnt it	0
Hmm	0
If I add them up I get 680	0
They go up by two	0
Yes	0
Many of you still dont know what that is as a decimal	0
Okay	0
The objective is to use your fraction circles to come up with the equivalent the common denominator in order to change it out	0
Okay	0
So you pay 12 plus the 1	0
All right you can quietly get started	0
Identity	0
I have a homework folder I didnt get a reading folder	0
Sir	0
Take any amount of turn	0
Good job	0
Okay	0
So this is similar to the ticket problem	0
Oh I cant write it can I	0
My mom makes it	0
Alright	0
Now with that I want you to make sense of that problem	0
Theres two rides from three to five so I go on a ride and I go on a ride again instead of just six points Can I have that	0
I know	0
and there are  Lets hope that you dont just stand on yours	0
So if you took steps of two over here thats fine	0
Yes	0
Now go ahead and make the you want to have a plus here	0
But Im not going to make you do all  of them	0
Okay	0
You can make a rectangle of this	0
So	0
So the problem is youre trying to figure out whos getting the most pizza	0
Yes there it is	0
Okay please be quick	0
That if you both have the same common denominator and got it there and your problem looks different on what you borrowed from the whole to subtract that is where your conversation needs to start	0
T couldnt have been born in the year 14965	0
Were talking about 12 minutes	0
Thank you David	0
Yes	0
Shh	0
Can I have a piece of paper	0
So now were going to go back	0
Okay	0
E yes	0
Thats still a negative there	0
Just come stand over here friends if I just called your name and River	0
You two are absolutely right	0
Go ahead	0
Bless you	0
Okay	0
Your first one is this way or this way	0
What if you called the zero to one a billion	0
Once you get a signature at the top youll grab your homework for tonight which is this white page	0
Okay	0
One two three heres five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 and then I have a little bit left over here	0
Hes gonna come and open it	0
Camilla found this pair on her number line	0
Your homework tonight is a separate page so youre aware of that	0
Its running	0
Okay	0
Remember the rules for Zukei	0
Wow	0
Ill give you a big hint	0
And from there you know your slope is negative one your Y intercept is zero	0
Hey our number model is still Because youre one of the people that just said you like pictures	0
To the fifth power	0
All right	0
I noticed that	0
I try to think about how I can show that angle side side	0
Asher Im laughing right now because you were secondguessing yourself as you were explained it like you had it	0
Yeah	0
179 youll practice using the algorithm and multiply fractions	0
Okay	0
Also we have some other stuff we have to do today	0
I cant just keep the numerators the same because I know anything I do to the bottom I need to do to the top	0
I mean youre breaking something apart	0
So in your group I would like you to this is going to have how youre going to help explain your reasoning	0
Nope	0
Okay lets finish today strong everybody we only have about probably a little under 20 minutes left	0
So 03 is our y intercept	0
Be back at 230 Please okay	0
I was 42 years old when I started teaching	0
Just check to be  sure that happens however you define it	0
Okay its done	0
Thats what you  would do	0
So if we add another two 25s then thats a dollar	0
Im okay	0
Yeah	0
So some of you had the three like one  third one third one third and you had it nine times	0
Okay	0
This one	0
We know we need to revise the other one	0
Thank you	0
Oh	0
So the side that is just one side	0
Yes	0
Thank you for teaching them	0
300 plus 20 plus three three three	0
To make it a little bit less on everybody today were going to skip number two and number three	0
Thank you to those friends whore over quickly quietly I want to talk about it	0
It is one square unit	0
Just going from here to here same height	0
that you have to get some routine to solve these factorizations quickly	0
All right	0
paid 141 for nine tickets to concerts	0
Working together	0
So this is when you have to use what you know about divisibility to get your balance down to one	0
All right you guys have a quiz Thursday	0
You should get a little closer to Meredith here and work with  these because she has them built and use these two and see if you  can imagine a third one even if you cant build it	0
That second one is a long one	0
Okay	0
Okay so she wants 58 of 34	0
Kyle G I called on you because I know youre good at your nines	0
Where are my papers	0
80100	0
Y2 Y2 Y1 Y1 X2 X2 X1 X1	0
Sorry	0
You will never learn this if youre not listening	0
Yes	0
All right	0
Yes	0
Yeah	0
The older brother	0
Im going to give Rene 10 seconds to solve it while I clear some space on my board	0
Id be interested to know	0
I think 8	0
So you said	0
Its an interesting question	0
One  candy bar	0
It was	0
Okay	0
20 seconds	0
Yes	0
So x1 x two and Id like to see every single person label this x 1 x two	0
But the whole point of having the table and these points is that you can actually have a perfectly straight line and know exactly where its supposed to go from this equation	0
Oh yes I will	0
I want to write these two numbers in expanded form	0
Okay Ethan and Alyssa	0
Ill give you guys a little more time this time around	0
Seriously	0
Youre going to have three pages	0
Okay	0
I moved it another 90	0
No	0
So there should be six rows	0
Its okay	0
So you guys for your constructive response you are going to follow the directions	0
Okay	0
Then go from there	0
Okay all four sides are equal	0
Thats a good way to think about it	0
A flat line that crosses that y equals three a vertical line that crosses at x equals four	0
She multiplied instead of writing one tenth plus one tenth plus one tenth	0
Yeah	0
Most people are doing a good job on deciding which ones which thats three comma 0	0
And sometimes when I divide by four I like to divide it in half and then divide my half in half again	0
Okay then Im going to add a room and Im going to do Remy Duncan	0
Im going to want these cards back so please cut them very nicely	0
Thats where were going right now in math	0
Reminder three keys to success show up to class every day	0
They gave me a grid which just makes it easier for me to make it perfect	0
Go	0
Theyre the same	0
Together	0
Shaded those two thirds and then split it this way shading these two thirds and these four	0
Thank you	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
Okay y equals 3x plus five	0
So we measure area with squares	0
Okay	0
So you said that it becomes  threesixths	0
In this situation you can make 135	0
As many as possible	0
Connect them and itll make more sense	0
You have twentyseven meters of ribbon	0
Come on	0
Can we do a nickname	0
Lets erase all of these here	0
Probably not	0
Theyre supposed to be sitting on the rug not on their desks so Im going to ask them to come to the floor get your spot your spot on the rug	0
Right	0
Okay	0
The Yintercept is  ld like you to write that in on your page	0
28 0049 0004 00007	0
Then the factor isnt four is it	0
Im going to have you do this with your partner so give it a second because youre going to have to find the ordered pair	0
I love that you said this	0
Last question	0
You didnt add your one and then eight and then my decimal and then two	0
Two people	0
Youre lying T	0
Okay three	0
Youre all wrong theyre not both right	0
Eh Ill take that	0
Okay	0
All right so were going to do the first one	0
But thats kind of hard to see how much one step is	0
Okay	0
So if it doesnt have a	0
Its only two friends that shes sharing it with	0
That division is not complete	0
Those of you that are still working were going to stop	0
We have one more were going to do together here	0
And they didnt use a question	0
problem number two	0
Get 15 good solid minutes of math done	0
Then Gabby you need to find a partner before you go anywhere	0
Youve got to bring your own pencils people Im not getting any of them back so now I dont have any	0
Let me catch up with you	0
Means to estimate an unknown value beyond known values	0
Now please take another yellow piece and add it to your circle	0
I already wrote down the different situations that we use multiplication if this helps you so that you dont get stuck thats great	0
Not everyone at the same time because we cant understand it	0
Okay	0
Can you come up here please	0
In the previous question one is plus and one minus	0
No you need to sit where I put you Addison	0
It shouldnt even maybe take you that long if you work as a team and calculate mean median and mode for the original set for this set of data and then go back and calculate mean median and mode for the retake	0
Thanks Lucas	0
Two more minutes	0
eight students are sharing seven pizzas	0
So the hint that I gave you was think of a small sample	0
That is in whole form	0
Or since youre already using your calculator you might as well just write its seven tangents	0
So one more second and finish writing	0
Im going to need to take a look at yours	0
Yeah I love it I love it	0
Excellent so for now you better get on top of it	0
So we are composing here were composing four fourths plus fourths plus four fourths plus one fourth plus 14	0
No way	0
Thats exactly what he did	0
Its just another extra step or two	0
Right now look at number one	0
Thatll work	0
You guys can sit down	0
Are you all as awake as I am	0
Okay	0
Okay fivefourthreetwoone	0
Okay	0
I have 13 days left out of my 90 day workout challange	0
Please quietly and carefully take all of your shapes collect them and put them into your bag	0
Okay that s really great	0
Twenty	0
My husband is from Nebraska and thats one of their claim to fames is that they invented koolaid	0
Start by folding it in half	0
The second group is where the vertex is inside the circle but its not on the center usually	0
All I really care about is what makes the denominator equal to zero	0
Pizzaria mama mia	0
Theres no way you could tell because if all the cookies all of the chips	0
Here we go	0
Twentyfive	0
Thats what I expect from fifth grade	0
River not Edwin	0
The reason why we started with math boxes is so we could practice Showdown and Pairs Compare because I want you to use Showdown and pairs compare later today in the lesson	0
Okay friends I want you to quietly try this one on your own	0
It can because you started here	0
Write down what your first question is	0
Sweet	0
Another way that some people might approach this problem is it might go like Okay well Im gonna go down to over four	0
Now the part four H plus three is the expression and then it says for H equals two	0
Heres the next one	0
Im sorry	0
You draw the triangle first yes	0
This person gets another one and that person gets another one	0
Okay	0
Nice job with your subitizing	0
And I could quickly clarify that	0
If you look very closely its nine cases of soda	0
Do we have to find another multiple to multiply it again	0
Okay go ahead	0
Im not saying voices off	0
Yes	0
Okay you all knew  but I really did switch that one on you	0
Okay	0
Or on the screen	0
Plus eight 16ths	0
Im going to leave this up here	0
Yes you will be doing this	0
Yeah	0
Im going to pretend that thats 150 skittles that Im dividing between six of you	0
Thank you	0
Then since theres two pouches and 11  5  6 I did 6  2 and then that equals 3	0
Erase your boards clean	0
So when you guys are explaining You need to pull up your mask again	0
Threeninths	0
So Ill just write down a little high	0
You also see now what is left over	0
That means that if you know that 6   3  2  then you can check it by saying 2 x 3  6	0
Original size in large	0
Okay	0
Oh yeah	0
Let me just sketch this if you dont mind	0
Turn the page	0
Thirty	0
Okay its in several places but theres theres one of them	0
I turned it into a six	0
That includes from other teams	0
We will take a break at some point throughout class today	0
Im going to start by	0
And Im a little hard of hearing	0
Were doing great today	0
C is at  and the last one is Z which is at  which is right above C Good	0
So if you look at the packet which you are all sharing as a group	0
At least it is for me that if you all you know is that theres an angle a side and an angle	0
All right thank you	0
I need this to be right so when I close these lines it doesnt	0
Negative one half and positive two	0
Because the red and the orange thats the  whole and 12 white ones make up the  whole	0
So is his money changing by 10 or changing by 400	0
Explain why your rule works	0
Yes	0
Were going to Define it	0
Ill show you what that is	0
Lets do 121	0
Whatever you do to the top you have to do to the bottom so 10 times 10 equals 100 and 10 times 4 equals 40	0
Yes Ive been with  a lot	0
You hand them 20 and they put a credit in your account and say you have 20 more dollars in the account they read a statement for you	0
And they would have some quality control and quantity control to ensure that there are a minimum number of chocolate chips	0
Im not so sure you know decimals to fractions even though you guys should really pay attention because this is the exact same thing you wrote over here	0
Michael	0
Yeah	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
So we basically show with the picture and so when you show you would probably want to do a little more explaining here so show explain your thinking I see youre thinking or maybe give a little explanation about it okay	0
So we could call this the length and we could call this the width or we could	0
Last but not the least oneninth plus onetenth	0
Okay that sound good	0
Here we go	0
No no	0
Do the next one by yourself	0
Im sorry	0
What I said yesterday is mainly for todays lesson	0
Thats one of the Okay so thats one of your thats one of your ground rules	0
So not your regular sides	0
It seems redundant but its really practical	0
Thank you for your patience	0
You mustnt think we have a problem we put a	0
I told you	0
This is a party	0
All right	0
We already have	0
It already says it up here	0
You just made a conjecture about what the new sailboats going to look like	0
All right	0
Oh table six you guys are killing me	0
Okay so I want you to think about something	0
Im going to give you a partner	0
Okay	0
Players sit so that they cannot see what the other is writing like a battleship type situation	0
Just watch	0
One divided by I  think if youre doing a division problem you  could do one divided by one sixth equal six  because it was like what we did when our  parents were here we did one divided by  one eighth equals eight so it was like well  what how many eighths are in one	0
And then that is fiveone so I come over to my five and I go up to my one	0
Now were focused	0
Also Im just reminding you I sent you an email this week with my survey about the class and about your feedback for that	0
Okay so he kind of did it parts at a time but not not like not by place value	0
I put it back in	0
This tells me the two of you are not listening when I talk	0
All right and so if youre adding a 14 to it and so you know its going to be greater	0
Okay begin	0
Lets see how Brian does	0
Okay	0
Whoops so sorry	0
Stand up push it away	0
Dont draw anything just tell me how you would check it first	0
All right I have no clue what to put first	0
The slope is separate	0
We know we want our numerators one	0
Excellent job	0
No	0
Okay good job	0
All right you guys have done a great job of hanging in there	0
Remember how were on task were helping each other but remember everybody try C on their own	0
Silva shouldered his way through the crowd until he was standing in front of the list	0
Okay all right	0
Let me  ask you something now	0
Its up to you	0
So the x value is three	0
Oops there is a same one right here	0
Yeah	0
Okay	0
I saw some hands up	0
And it asked the question  What fraction of the candies has Amy eaten	0
You keep the same Y value because youre not changing the height from your shape	0
Ok thats thats fair enough	0
They what they do is they say each cookie say weigh weighs um say X number of grams	0
an even amount	0
I am so confused	0
Thats what I always do	0
Ms Rossi Find the problem that says original sailboat	0
Uh lets do number 20 then	0
Yeah	0
To do a	0
Okay lets stop there	0
I think were good	0
You write wrong things down but you do the calculations correctly	0
So I was at 150 and then I had 25 and I wanted to get up to 175	0
It could be here	0
So if you make mistakes you just cross it out	0
Take a look at what I drew	0
You are right I do	0
Thats right	0
Right	0
We ll move on and then I ll ask you a bit more	0
Im trying to find out what the power would be	0
Yes we know fraction of problems	0
For the first one put the numbers in order goes in the first box	0
Awesome	0
It looks like to me that you mightve traveled on the yaxis	0
I think there might be	0
Im going to go ahead and stop us here	0
But using those laws right there if you start thinking about it	0
Yeah	0
Okay	0
Austin yours was opened and completed Kohls was not Emilys was opened	0
Hold out your arms	0
These are going to stay separate but they are going to stay proportionate to each other	0
So I know that if Im multiplying a whole times a half or anything less than one its going to be less than  the factor	0
No I want you to do your work at your table and then move around wherever you want	0
Not all of them but most of them	0
Uhm	0
Well	0
Okay	0
Friends you should be able to add those	0
Will using an estimate help	0
So Verizon even though it has that upfront cost is still cheaper because when youre paying three cents a text and youre sending out here 2500 texts that extra two cents on all those texts is starting to add up	0
So youre going to be playing against yourself	0
They are evenish	0
That looks perfect	0
Do skip counting by two	0
You have to make sure of that	0
Time is up	0
Heres one heres one  youve got that in your mind	0
Really is that	0
Seven is 27	0
Thats where the plus two B Y emerge from and they lead me to these twelve B Y	0
So from there you need to establish what number should go on your line plot based on the data that you have in the chart on the left	0
Okay	0
Thats what I was looking for	0
10 times 40 is 400 10 times eight is 80 two times 40 is 80 and two times eight is 16	0
And its worth eight points	0
Why dont you go through and when youre all done Ill ask my question	0

Sometimes that is easier	0
Or 075	0
They all represent the same thing	0
Yes just like you did	0
Close	0

No	0
If it will let you	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
I want to see a whole sentence so start with your sentence starter of the ratio of	0
Or because we have the aStudentsociative property in math we go two times two and X times X	0
For today what youre going to be doing to start off math is youre going to try to solve a problem with multiple steps	0
Its a sketch of data in which checkmarks Xs or other marks above a labeled line show how many times this value appears	0
Once again lets set up our ratio table	0
Then well work on the spreadsheet after that	0
Im not sure	0
Here we go	0
Youre going to turn over three cards	0
Youre very very close	0
Well actually lets start by filling in these points	0
Sorry lets talk about this table	0
Then you add it over to the denominator	0
What white paper	0
Now weve got a 58 inch orangutan	0
Yes	0
Because 25 times nine up there then theres 25 times nine up there plus eight which is added to it	0
Right	0
Yes	0
Please move your paper so only you can see it	0
You know	0
And so what Id like you to do is on your whiteboards I want you to show me how you would add that up	0
Good	0
Okay Im going to show you for three seconds	0
Break it up into steps	0
Okay so um as were as Im kind of switching this over I really want everyone to think about because now the triangles are going to be kind of in different like different positions like trying to hit like instead of being in the same orientation one of them might be rotated a little bit	0
So we re going to push you a little bit  more to reason like a mathematician	0
Ah	0
And I think Jeff  hasnt been with us for a while and he doesnt know what  were talking about but lets take one at a time	0
I wasnt expecting it to that	0
Why would I tell you	0
0	0
I dont know	0

Now if you need to you can just cross these out so they dont confuse you	0
Uh huh	0
Well I put the four blocks up to the brown	0
Which means what I would have added here was because when you multiply 5 x 6 it equals 24	0
Four	0
Yes	0
I think we have other numbers to try here	0
Page one has five equations I want you to graph	0
Divisor	0
Until the end of math you shouldnt be writing anything	0
I guess Ill just graph it myself	0

You can turn your chair	0
Its a triangle dont forget to divide by two	0
All right	0
And I know I can put those together to make one whole	0
So this would be two thirds and this would be one third	0
Right	0
Oh is that on record	0
Tada	0
Percent	0
Go	0
But when you try to add all those up at the end its going to be very difficult for you to do so	0

Did he	0
You cant	0
I wish there was an option to just erase everything all at once	0
To do this the numerator and denominator of the fraction we start with must have a common factor	0
Youve got to read the questions carefully	0
Please begin	0
Then you were correct  Ill be right back guys	0
Hmm	0
Very good	0
Is each of those blocks a packet	0
Make sure they stay focused so that youll learn	0
down from left to right is negative completely flat like this is a slope of zero and up and down like this is undefined	0
Im going to have you when I say go put your homework in a place that you will be able to find it	0

Its a pretty simple definition but shes right	0
Cover your work please cover your work	0
What Eliza said I can paraphrase is that you can make sure you dont skip a step	0
The short side that is five	0
You guys may begin	0
There you go	0
Im not sure a lot of us are going to look at this recipe	0
59	0
Nice job my loves	0
Well skip that one	0
Yeah	0
Heres give this one to Jordan	0
Okay so for tonights homework we are going to be decomposing fractions  diagram	0
Oh thats why youre over	0
Just how I did it	0
Ms Tolliver You made a perfect fraction	0
All right now this one in expanded form	0
Thats your objective for today	0
Oh wait	0
There you go buddy	0
Yeah	0
How many crackers did he have left	0
Triangle plus a square plus another triangle	0
You got a partner to talk to	0
And kind of as youre getting started here I just want to say as well so this type of problem	0
All right	0
And I see I know it begins with an A Ashank	0
Isnt that nice	0
We have quadrant four and quadrant three	0
What	0
Put those three	0
Yes exactly one third correct	0
Number four says color part of the grid to show the decimal they gave you	0
Is it that	0
Okay here we go	0
I used Phillies in my other classes but for you Tim I used Eagles	0
I look at my pattern and it tells me how much fabric I need to buy in order to make my dresses	0
Our denominators dont match	0
This is going to be a twoday activity	0
Good	0
Denisa has four up there which is fine	0
Those are conversions right when youre talking about units	0
Not sure the page	0
We will come back to those	0
Lets say we try the light blue	0
And it comes over here and	0
Nice job	0
Im worried that were not awake on this Monday morning	0
Actually I used this to um to tell that the light green is one white  bigger	0
Your thinking	0
Yeah they line up with 24	0
For the convenience of explanation we will put in symbols	0
Im  glad I saw that lovely model	0
Try it both ways and see if you can get the right answer	0
Zero three and six is right though right	0
Im so glad your packets are coming to SS every day	0
You can fill this in	0
Multiplication	0
Problem number 10	0
Yes	0
When the bottom wins up here 100 youre going to be doing this in groups and Im going to be quiet and walk around and see what you guys are talking about	0
I think this is what it means overall	0
Okay	0
Uhhuh Mrs Gibson we did that in fourth grade	0
Youll do factors	0
How about on the half dollar	0
Theres 70 and thats not single number	0
Okay	0
How many	0
Next I have chosen 5   10	0
That poster over there behind Murphy s head thank you Murphy has examples	0
And then three groups of 12	0
Okay	0
These are the most delicious gray brownies you have ever seen you are pretending they are delicious	0
I calculate each time what I get with uh with every number	0
Now I have a capital letter at the beginning of my sentence	0
Lets add together our whole numbers here	0
And you absolutely can do that	0
And they So six to the zero power is one	0
Okay hum let s take some out	0
Theres four more on the back page	0
Good	0
Already you found two	0
Its weird	0
Dont forget to do your estimate	0
And they want you to	0
Now heres what I want you to do	0
Times 300	0
So what I do when I do this is eightone fiveone and I use my straight edge	0
I heard something really interesting from table two	0
Great awesome	0
Now number two says that theyve decided to bake 48 muffins instead of 12	0
4 times 4 is 16 thatd be your next point	0
He lives in the upstairs	0
Awesome okay	0
So like this we can write today this ones 70 this ones 70 this ones 70 write all those in Im gonna erase those just because I dont want to make it too confusing	0
Why do you guys think The most interesting questions are always the why questions	0
Realworld context is because thats why youre learning math thats why you learn math	0
The Pythagorean theorem in solid geometry	0
No hes Jeff	0
So heads together and figure out a problem	0
And then you might even see it written as a fraction one on top of the other	0
Okay	0
Very good	0
So if I divide if like I give each rabbit or like the six carrots goes into the rabbits twice I guess I	0
I am crazy about diagrams	0
Okay so were gonna start with two	0
There is a difference between a bar graph and a histogram	0
Okay this is	0
Its going to tell you your light green wedge and then youre going to measure how many light green wedges	0
It was broken up into three columns and then four  rows	0
To at the camera show me the camera	0
Weve got some stuff to do today so lets talk about this	0
Yeah three four five triangle	0
Oh	0
Last night your homework brought you to the hidden treasure which matched the game that we played	0
Six  four 46	0
Right	0
Seven is three	0
So and I mean thats not fun	0
I had eightsixteenths	0
Yes I need extra help	0
Please move in and be on the team line	0
I think they re due Monday	0
10 years	0
Okay go to the next problem	0
This is radical three	0
Pass it	0
They used adapt and change so you are adapting the math problem by changing the alignment	0
Im going to let you do this as a table group	0
All right I need you guys	0
And we only use Pythagoras in a rightangled triangle	0
Lets go	0
The way you find slope is you go Y2 minus Y1 over X2 minus X1	0
But leave your answer in terms of Pi for these	0
Cut the straw already	0
Lindsey it looks like youre working on an equivalent ratio	0
Im going to show you guys a couple of patterns	0
Well you could do like what Daniel did 5687 or 8756	0
Oh yes	0
Okay	0
So then leftover Ive got one half	0
Okay	0
There we go	0
We are spending some more time Eleanor will you turn yours on	0
Landon can you respond to what Okay lids on your markers	0
Ten tenths	0
Im done	0
My Computer wasnt responding so I had to reboot it	0
Zero point four to the ten thousandths	0
Alan that is not what I am saying	0
That there would be   school on Saturday	0
A factor rainbow	0
Oh because if you know for every 210 that would be 24	0
You pick I dont care	0
And then on page 103 Im going to have you do number one and four Thats it	0
Okay	0
Lets start by drawing a diagram	0
That might be a lot of money	0
This is a five one	0
Oh can we say Why	0
Okay whoevers got mic dont touch him please	0
Well theyre obviously on five and	0
Okay when you have it folded in half just show me you do like this	0
That was probably the most writing we did on one page of this whole packet	0
Okay so you guys have a handy dandy multiplication chart	0
Make sure you write your list over here okay	0
Okay	0
I want to move this just so it picks up your conversations	0
Hunter did	0
We have a total of 47 apples and were trying to put them on trays that hold carrots	0
Divide the number No no dont erase Gary	0
So tell her nine oclock is great	0
Greater	0
Ive revised decisions	0
Okay	0
Zero	0
So today Id like you to work independently and check your answers with a partner	0
Okay go ahead	0
Yeah we must add that yeah well 26	0
Look up at me	0
Im sorry	0
that 2 14 is the same thing as saying 94 its thats just split up into different pieces	0
Thats something thats kind of been our goto	0
The next thing were going to figure out is how many yerts were going to need	0
You dont have to sit on a red dot	0
And were going to look at it two different ways	0
So this gets us into our constructed response just thinking about it	0
So point B is in the interior of angle A OC then were going to figure something out	0
Youre correct its not significant but that has no significance either	0
All right	0
I had some confusion around the room	0
Now the last thing were going to do before we take a small break is sketch a graph at the right to show the relationship	0
Wonderful	0
Because 3 3612	0
To start off here is what we are going to do	0
Make a 90degree angle	0
Okay	0
Theyre not a whole yet	0
Three boxes would be nine and threethirds but threethirds is another whole so three boxes wed have 10	0
Yes	0
One plus whatever is in your table	0
Add them	0
Yes	0
Im going to look at San Diego theyre buying three train tickets	0
So you basically finding number Two numbers that youre calculating and then give them letters	0
Yes this ones a little confusing	0
And I want  you to think about that that notion of stamping to figure out  the surface area of each rod	0
Raise your hand if youre person A I see Daniel and Kevin are person As at their table	0
Its the only one thats been touched by every single person	0
So that would be one third	0
Do we do math lab together	0
Thank you	0
Two	0
So now let me show you what I did	0
Im multiples	0
The same thing any two points will work	0
The Wild World	0
See the numbers you add that number with itself and you get the answer which is the difference betweenthe next numbers	0
It doesnt matter the order	0
And then you are going to share out your answers together	0
They cost 2 each and we must multiply it because we need nine packages	0
Okay Adeline is mixing fruit juices to make punch	0
Again Im going to walk around and hear what youre talking about	0
Thats number one	0
So for this one	0
Divided by a half	0
Just like you have made one equation here	0
Yes	0
I just want to see about Lets see	0
So really try to stick to the rules those steps	0
Are we working with partners at our tables	0
Okay	0
It says use the grids below to create order value bar graphs for each boy	0
Leslie has two pieces of pita bread to share with her friends	0
Im going to keep half and have her three daughters divide the other half	0
It is fair	0
And just give you a little bit more points in that category	0
This one table two I reSSy like this mathematical relationship because it looks like this	0
I got 781	0
So we know that we have three wholes and then our fraction piece is done in twothirds	0
Yeah	0
Sure	0
We already got seven	0
There is something else I want to talk about at the end about the numbers she chose	0
Yes I do not see that page in here	0
So yeah your estimate is something that you can work to determine	0
Okay so we did get 12 plus  is 910	0
I was just saying that	0
in my both sections of that rectangle	0
Were writing in our notebooks not our math journals our math notebooks	0
This one is going to be x two y two because x value y value and these are the second points its the second pair of points	0
Later on youll understand where hes going with this	0
Because  maybe if I subtracted maybe I thought I would get the answer	0
Solve with your knee to knee partner	0
Okay let us know when you ve got a problem	0
I think we were doing I think thats for tomorrow now that I think about it because fraction of is on the computers	0
All the time	0
These are rules which you must master	0
Why is it always doing this	0
Abby and	0
So James says Hey lets take 400 minus 340	0
Um which is another one others might not have thought of that one but you could test that conjecture as well	0
I want to show you again	0
You already have that	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
Because were talking about volume	0
I can find the area when the perimeter and only one side length are known	0
Six boards and 15	0
Okay were just gonna write that really quickly for each one diagonals bisect	0
But then you doubled it to get back to the original	0
Yeah	0
You might add on to the conversation you might agree with someone you might have something different	0
I think a minute was too long	0
Let me make sure I keep track of the time too	0
Youre going to enter your numbers there	0
Okay	0
Youll be able to do it on your own	0
Okay ladies have a seat	0
Were going to look at the first part theres no writing for that part	0
really tough crowd today	0
Look at  asking us to do	0
So think about what what sort of situation that is All right Im seeing some great stories so far	0
Theres four pizzas	0
If I look its the same fractions six13ths six10ths sixninths	0
Pass that forward please	0
Well just see it	0
the bottom	0
Always	0
Lets make it a four game series	0
That is not too smart	0
So it is not exactly a coincidence	0
And its not a whole number	0
Im not coming for snacks	0
Using these labels here are common denominators	0
You get past	0
So you have	0
Were going to continue talking about these tomorrow but we are going to do a little bit more today	0
You have to explain your thinking because I see some friends who are confused so I need someone who knows their benchmark fractions and can explain their thinking well	0
Those are parallel	0
He says seven eighths I think is the biggest because theres a smaller sliver left	0
Make onequarter turn	0
Why is Abraham Lincoln our first president	0
Break your rectangle into eight pieces	0
I know that if the first one is a whole number its going to be less than	0
Because I want to make sure that we have time for a break and to get to those other other questions for today	0
here	0
clarification	0
Okay	0
Halfway between zero and   is  2	0
Georgia will you worked with Malika	0
For now when we practice theyll all be whole numbers	0
Yes	0
These would be a 1 each check at Costco but they might be 167 at King Soopers	0
Ill give you some hints	0
So heres Cassidys diagram	0
I heard both	0
Negative 325	0
No thats too hard	0
Put those numbers	0
Anna Emily Dana Anthony Emily Ethan  Harper Henry and Michael	0
It doesnt really  as it is as long as we represent it	0
Could you say techniques on how to solve problems	0
You have a microphone	0
You guys all have very good reasons why you think that you agree or disagree	0
Charlie	0
Okay	0
That	0
Okay	0
And you could say how much its going to be wider by too	0
Zoey	0
Oh no that was just the minus x I was trying to	0
I agree that Hunter is right	0
they become equal	0
Yes	0
I wont take that away from you	0
Thats all I wanted you to do	0
This is the expression	0
We can do this in about three minutes	0
missed you	0
Five points for that homework five questions	0
So then I knew	0
Number down the side and number or colors	0
So thats a pattern weve already talked about its always going to work if its the slope if the slope is two	0
When you have to double it again in order for it to be two flowers	0
So it takes two fifths to equal 110	0
From which work	0
Gum	0
And I want you to think about this problem using your mental math	0
I would get a highlighter out there and highlight prism and highlight that has two parallel identical bases	0
So lets think about the next one	0
Now lets look at the pattern that Im talking about	0
Oh of course you may	0
If you like us	0
If I need to I can just fill in other classes and not this one if were just going to focus on that	0
All right guys	0
Just know that that two doesnt have	0
Yes thats correct	0
One minus negative three	0
Lets try it this way all manipulatives back on the tray	0
B	0
Okay	0
Its like a story   I think where a realworld context is like   about stuff that can happen in real world that you could use that math for	0
And third period really enjoyed this joke	0
Youre not adding	0
So here is the problem that we are going to solve	0
There is nothing the same about them	0
Why is it not working	0
Were going to take Reggies house	0
Like Gru says in Despicable Me light bulb	0
When you pull out your fraction circles	0
about one minute to copy this down	0
Okay	0
Heads up	0
Its important that you tell me the place values too	0
If I called your name please come up here with your math journals	0
Now that we got it set up nows the fun part the multiplying for those of you who know your facts	0
You should	0
Cool	0
Here is a list of the numbers that don t work	0
Hold on	0
Thats the third one it says A plus B and A minus B	0
Okay so what Im going to do first is just estimate here	0
And that would be negative five youre still spending 5 per week	0
Perfect	0
But the author could have or the writer could have put that put it all together for us so that we understood why it was important	0
Posters need to be on the board	0
Open them to page 71	0
Or maybe you got better at making tables	0
Who does	0
Listening with rods means the following  when someone is giving an explanation what you should be doing is  at your seat building what they are building up there	0
Okay	0
Um yes	0
Its getting seriously tricky	0
That is the work pages	0
Okay now remember someone else may take your number so you had better have  a few extra numbers ready to go and place them on that number line and if indeed  we find that some of you disagree then you will have to argue why you are  placing it	0
You got you got yeah	0
Thanks friend	0
Right	0
They did 70 x 30 and they got 2100	0
Mm hm	0
Okay	0
No its not twohundredandninetytwozero its 2920	0
Three times threefourths is going to be greater than threefourths	0
Thats a run of six six or sorry four minus negative two is Six	0
Whoa	0
Thats y one right here	0
You can check it this way	0
Okay	0
Alrighty	0
But thats not going to happen	0
It could happen yes	0
Addie can you sit up please	0
You got to talk up	0
Okay we get the idea	0
Okay	0
Let me see	0
I always go five and then up to nine	0
I feel like this is confusing	0
Its good if you come up with an answer but please think about what you need to know about how many to buy	0
Did you know that	0
30 seconds go get get it get in	0
Very interesting	0
I wonder	0
oh no youre right youre right youre right	0
So youre going to have one two three diagonals away over here	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Remember youre ignoring this other half right now	0
and put them in the offertory box and continue their prayers until either wallet becomes empty	0
Nope	0
Dont worry about the two outliers	0
However when my numerators are the same I can actually look at my denominators and I can say okay I know I have three pieces filled in or three jumps on each of these two fractions	0
The next one we do is going to be really specific and theyre going to want us to draw a certain picture	0
31	0
No its in the way	0
And if I now know that Im doing 80 times three I know that my answer has to be at least 200 and something	0
Youre not supposed to have feelings	0
Okay	0
Parker stop	0
And then I went up to 12	0
I should see them on all of them but I forget	0
Okay	0
These are a linear pair	0
Yes	0
Twenty	0
Now I still recommend to write out your values from least to greatest so if you write them out from least to greatest this is what youre going to have	0
All right	0
See my screen	0
560	0
Oh I was trying to get you	0
And then put these together and make this smaller than four	0
Lets keep going	0
Okay	0
Now let go	0
You cant make anything without shapes	0
It sure is	0
If we do sine divided by cosine we will have radical three over two over onehalf	0
Oh	0
Its not just 500 its a little more than just 500	0
So we dont have to do anything else but you did a really nice job Selma comparing your two ratio tables	0
Phillipa are you back	0
Okay	0
How about cm	0
But he knew that that one and that extra was closest to another number two good job	0
But remember our goal is not 20 yerts its 19	0
So Melissa Jackson Precious and Melvin thanks for clicking the link	0
I know thats what Im telling you	0
That is the same denominator	0
And I dont	0
Oh 65	0
Yes Eli	0
All right	0
Now what I mean by that is when you get right here after you subtracted you have to check	0
One person	0
Thats going to be my challenge	0
So our learning intention is I can use lists of multiples to find and choose partial quotients	0
numerator numerator	0
You did nine times Sorry	0
Oh no did this just freeze on me	0
The slope of this line is negative two	0
okay	0
I wen over to five and then since when were doing our Xaxis or whatever we have the dot right there	0
You are going to complete	0
Often from smallest to largest or from largest to smallest	0
You should be using nine boxes	0
Yes I was able to use the fraction circles	0
Once you got it out on your desk I would like you to discuss at your table groups what your answers are	0
Look at all the numbers are added up	0
And now Bens idea still worked but it might be difficult for you	0
What you should do is just pick one of the things that you know and start narrowing down your choices	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
All right Donna	0
Thats definitely a conversion	0
Is that true	0
Because now you have the whole equation	0
It says battery low	0
Okay	0
Roberto let me see yours real quick	0
Im sorry	0
Because we put those in fifths	0
Round three and eighteen hundredths to the nearest tenth	0
Either one works	0
I wish I could get a better grade there	0
You are going to need whatever you use for a calculator right now because were going to talk about cubes and cube roots	0
Go to a zero in three two and one	0
Great job	0
If weve made mistakes with the calculations	0
All right	0
Period	0
What should I say what I wrote for number six	0
Thats my 25 mark	0
I was just doing the first number half of this number and then it is still the same rule	0
And well use the second one but the second And these are our last two examples for Spheres	0
That gets rid of ps from that side	0
Then you wont talk with your partner	0
What someone else was saying today is something like this	0
So I hear you did a great job yesterday	0
If you take this and it has three thirds	0
Were going to circle the one that were going to use	0
Sure	0
Then youve got to angle this	0
So  Oh you need me to check   Good job girl	0
So fraction pieces are tools number lines are tools	0
Yeah yeah	0
Yes	0
All right you should be beyond the first page pretty quickly here guys	0
And that was your explanation for the  the halves that came into it	0
Okay or you could say or one and a half three halves or you could even say 15	0
If we do this	0
Landon who else was in your group	0
the quadrilateral	0
Were going to really work on cheering for people when they present	0
Can I draw a diagram for this	0
Otherwise I wont write it down	0
to work with the left part and the right part separately	0
So for us a point is where something starts or stops	0
Break it apart but like how do I get it if I want it	0
Okay	0
So Jake is designing a picture for the cover of his reading folder	0
Okay	0
eight and half of six eighths would be three eighths	0
Number two angle C	0
Can you fill it out though	0
No math isnt over	0
so if you look at this we have three and 482 thousandths	0
I wonder if there s a way of simplifying it	0
Josh drew one two three four in each one	0
Im going to do 3 x 30	0
Yes	0
Yes	0
I dont need you to solve it	0
At about lets say four or five minutes Im going to make all of you do it anyways	0
Carry my decimal point down	0
So our answer is 712	0
Find for me an area and a perimeter	0
And two squared	0
10	0
Excellent	0
All right	0
And then I would do two sixths I do half first and then split that into three	0
718 thousandths	0
Thats a twostep equation	0
Today Id like you to read our learning intention today	0
Right Josie	0
You are going to solve this problem and bring me your sticky note with your name on top	0
I would just write it like this	0
You would get twofourths	0
I need a partner for Rob who is done	0
Rebeccal I need you to stop	0
Do you want to work with those guys back at that table	0
Yeah	0
Theyre both even so you could start with that	0
Think about that	0
So who can tell me Ah Rachel	0
Hello	0
I want you to divide 200 dollars in the ratio one to three	0
You mean like a drawing something you can see	0
Just talking about it	0
no you do not	0
All right	0
So we kind of said why the seven eight is close to one whole pizza	0
Our scissors are there in case you need them	0
Yeah	0
I have to label this in portions	0
I do not believe I took attendance	0
Umm this one is not that bad	0
Shes not speeding up and then slowing down and then speeding up as is Jada	0
No	0
What color is it for	0
Good	0
Okay	0
Thats not really how you eat pizzas	0
That sounds right to me	0
This one would probably be best done by	0
Okay	0
That middle point is zero	0
So youre absolutely right	0
Its the answer	0
Okay and I put in this 10 in the table to kind of trick everybody a little bit to mess up the pattern and make you think about where the next point is going to be on the graph	0
Remember yesterday that the design if you are we didnt do any writings just then	0
Like theres like the arrows that kind of cut do like the line kind of thing	0
Because 12 plus 1 is 13	0
You totRamona could do that	0
You practiced those models	0
If you are in the third row youre going to spin around and  Michelle Im going to have you bump over to this team and youre going to be with Mike	0
Turn the cameras on	0
Im glad it was helpful	0
Yes because if Im going left its	0
So we just add our three tenths and look at what we have	0
Oh I love this Belle is writing it down Samanthas writing it down	0
Im just going to go four three	0
So Skyler used more	0
Youre not gluing them in there	0
Were going to use the back tomorrow	0
they came up and shared	0
The faster you drive the more is added to braking distance	0
It has to be a perfect though to make it a sphere	0
Tralee	0
Now	0
So find the next thing make a table about it	0
Thank you	0
Ill split it	0
But you could think about your slope as down four over two	0
Lindsey	0
Ok could you write that up	0
No	0
Or her	0
You have to double the X and the Y coordinate	0
I also have  so Im going to go with X and X is going to give me X minus 3 equals 2 radical x3	0
All right I think a couple people maybe are a little stuck	0
All right yay	0
Okay	0
Do this first	0
I think its a shape thats	0
This first video that Im going to do is a basic review on partial quotients	0
The  two reds make a half and the two reds make a half	0
I want to warn you	0
Were going to use the pattern	0
You guys  he has the longer hair	0
You could try 2 and 23	0
So the reason I think it is so important for you to understand your misconception is that that allows it to make better sense in your head	0
We re not gonna get started on this in class	0
A mathematical model if I asked for that specifically would be numbers using an operation	0
Yes this is PAMP 51	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
We dont have too much time here	0
We have to make it relevant to our daily lives	0
Just thinking forward	0
I saw that it was a square and then I counted the three on the side and then multiplied that by three	0
Negative 20 squared equals 400 plus 20 squared is also 400 and that totals 800	0
Connor I dont want you erasing your answers	0
Thats perfect	0
Im coming Im here	0
Okay very nice thank you Mark	0
And thats because you go up by one and a half	0
Lets see zero times seven is 05 times seven is 35 you can carry the three so to speak five times sorry one times seven is seven plus that three is going to be 10	0
Near the very far end of your number line	0
Get to school with you and then well bookmark it so you have it in there	0
Thats a big word	0
So what Im doing is Im taking the smaller number	0
And you are going to solve it and put your answer in the chat once Oh here we go	0
Okay	0
I have 33 hundredths plus 54 hundredths	0
So complete this screen then explain your thinking with a partner	0
I know it doesnt matter probably	0
I cant see the numbers	0
Which object is bigger	0
Okay	0
With this symbol	0
Okay guarders up	0
Can I see your book please	0
Were going to give each of these blocks a value of 7	0
This says We can think of the division expression 10 and twohalves 10 divided by twohalves	0
Ill think of an example	0
Was there enough for you guys back there	0
Okay Im gonna write an arrow here	0
Okay	0
Maybe theres something about that as well	0
I changed this the last class	0
So using what we just talked about to solve which one is bigger	0
All you have to do is use this	0
All of your Mug Wump points ended up in that quadrant because there were no negatives	0
You guys have been dealing with fraction bars since you were very little	0
We have 15 of a block	0
Im going to turn it off for a minute so it doesnt follow me	0
So we have two thirds plus two thirds	0
Bring your sheet	0
Five or greater just add more four less let it rest	0
This	0
Yes	0
Now with your partner I am going to ask you to do some mental math	0
Okay I know we might be spending a lot of time on this one picture but I think is really important to think of it this way	0
Okay so right there we can probably say these are going to be similar because this is 70	0
She said ten onehundredths	0
You see Fujitas is	0
Right	0
But the if you knew what cards it might help with the explanation	0
Im asking a question	0
Lets talk about some of the points here	0
Like this	0
If its proportional its also definitely linear	0
This is supposed to be her piece of the land but half of it is getting given to the older sister	0
Find your two little sheets of paper that are your fifths and your tenths and hold them up in the air	0
Its altogether 990 yen and youll only get 10 yen in change	0
All right	0
Youve got to make sure	0
So we are going to be using representation	0
Im going to do that right now actually	0
Thats reasonable	0
Either way Im going to say explain why it is or explain why it is not	0
Cups are sold in packs of eight and plates are sold in packs of six	0
So dont Mollyy	0
Remember our little rhyme that we had in our head was y in the sky you put the y value on the top and then you look at it and its a plus three over a plus one	0
Negative sign in front of the square root	0
Wait	0
Mine is graded	0
So x equals 7	0
Lets highlight that	0
Michael didnt  Meredith did	0
Thank you Landon	0
Theres no Yintercept	0
Okay	0
Thank you	0
Thats just a half	0
Okay sorry I forgot to add those	0
If you dont Im going to draw a rectangle 12345678	0
Hey Christian	0
We all got 11	0
Okay	0
Heres what Im going to have you do	0
12345678910 18	0
So Im gonna put checkmarks down here if they are done but they are closed	0
You are telling me	0
All right please get this each	0
So now its true on the other hand for that part	0
Maybe my brother has them	0
Think about the movie we just watched	0
But lets say we didnt know that	0
Thank you	0
And Im going to be here for office hours if you need to come see me	0
Quickly jump in with John or Josh	0
Thats right	0
40 miles per hour means 40   hours  the total miles	0
And then we want to add to that two and two fourths so I start here and I know that if I add one to that thats going to be two and three fourths	0
So Im going to write it out on the side so you can see and see how the words are spelled out a little bit better	0
10 and zero	0
One times three is three	0
One times three is three	0
You need to be dreaming of this before you go to bed	0
So if I do this I should find the answer	0
My hands are old	0
So count by fives with me	0
Do we need to write zero out	0
Make sure no one makes a mistake	0
Number fours youre up	0
Looks like were getting the hang of writing these things in the equation a little bit	0
Its okay if first of all you get one but	0
So I used adding and multiplication because as you can see at the top of these two numbers it just goes one two but if you count by twos it actually gets here	0
okay	0
Okay	0
When youre in team mode feel free to talk	0
Find your area model	0
Okay I have created five unit reviews for you that are in the exam login	0
This one no	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Its been a little while	0
I m not sure I understand what you are saying	0
I want you to think about math when you come up with rules	0
I can create fraction multiplication number problems with realworld contact or situations	0
We have one10th onethird onesixth smallest to largest	0
Two more because I just gave you two of them	0
You think the boats the biggest	0
For one package	0
dont have to do anything else except for find the slope of the line	0
There is no restriction because its a smooth	0
One two three four	0
When you are done show me you are done by getting your  out and working on thats just 413	0
Everyone do it to the best of their ability	0
But  our first time that were talking about a remainder	0
Just two fraction addition problems for seven sixths	0
Give me five	0
Let s finish this up and do the last two problems	0
Okay	0
Three	0
Wheres the oh right here	0
Okay we need to have another discussion	0
So once you multiply across to know if I have a half of three fourths then I have three eighths somehow I need to make my area model have eight squares three of which have two of the shadings in it	0
Okay so hold on to it	0
Thirds	0
It should join up	0
Well maybe you gotta make it bigger	0
Also you can see almost the exact the same with two	0
Yes you can that way very good	0
All right	0
So we are going to do 850 divided by four	0
Clay youre going to go back and work with the group of three	0
In your toolkit you guys have the success criteria for surface area and volume you glued it in on the page like something I dont know 20ish 18	0
Okay	0
All right	0
This is  of drawing circles and think about how many pieces equal one whole	0
Trevors here	0
Hes like no inaudible no	0
Making sure we are accurate when we multiply it will be 19x4	0
Thatll be good practice for sure	0
Perfect	0
First we find one fifth	0
All right so  lets start at  the top	0
Were doing awesome today	0
You can keep that	0
You two were the ones that thought Sadie was right lets go	0
You re closest to five because 56 is a large number	0
Its not right	0
I just	0
No	0
As long as you revise but make sure your names on everything	0
Yes youre supposed	0
Because we need four of them	0
But it passes through that point	0
For E this is a division problem	0
Dont be embarrassed	0
I dont think so	0
Han can move five boxes every half hour	0
To the thousandths place	0
Okay	0
Do not help them yet	0
For photo or video	0
Alright	0
No	0
Huh	0
Dont worry about that yet	0
And Im going to do these next to kind of for you	0
Yes	0
My little half circles	0
Okay	0
and you go	0
Cool	0
Overall in our whole family	0
Now she does	0
Okay	0
Okay so there were some different strategies	0
Michelle and Erin	0
Your first question says what is each animals unit rates	0
I didnt you a long time but I do want to talk through this problem	0
Then when I do my inside guy right there I get another 3 x	0
Youre dong like how somebody has got like multiple data points like	0
Dont talk to your neighbor	0
One two three four just looking at this side going vertically	0
There s no right or wrong answer here	0
Everyone else pick up your whiteboards and show me your answers	0
Because were breaking it into smaller chunks every single time	0
Number 11 I did partially with an x2 and then partially with an x2	0
Percentages I just heard aSsay When Im I ever going to need to know any of this in my life	0
Right ready Im gonna give you just a minute to share and help each other make sure that theyre both correct	0
Sometimes it a good idea to have the numbers which tells us how many of those ones we ve countedup which is what Alan is saying how many of those rods we were countingup	0
Yeah	0
Still waiting for blue hands	0
So that is the right answer	0
Straight angle	0
Two of the fifths all the way down	0
I dont know	0
Okay	0
So every fraction can be rewritten as a decimal	0
Three works right	0
If you messed up put it away I do not want you to get confused	0
Hello love	0
Two times three	0
I agree with the statement	0
Then my equation would be five times three and then Im going to figure out my area	0
Yeah but there arent anymore at all	0
Oh let me shrink that downOkay there you go	0
Why does is say 1	0
Im sorry	0
The one about the replica of the first fleet	0
Stop	0
Correct	0
Exactly	0
Thats interesting	0
All right	0
This person did it right	0
So its all really about that this is all parts of totals	0
The problem asks up to how many can you buy	0
Once again you forgot to	0
They have the same denominator	0
If theyre on the Xaxis its X comma zero	0
Yep	0
David Leo and Miles	0
So the vocabulary is adapt to adjust the problem numbers and decimal places in correct positions	0
I did	0
9 5	0
Is the dot here yeah there s the crease	0
OK let me say the people with the secret would like to publish it now when scientists really discovered something they do what they call publishing they send it to a journal and it gets printed and everybody reads it	0
Step 2 multiply step 3 subtract	0
Okay	0
So now I want you can you see my board over here	0
You can tell that because it says between zero and one so you can tell where the fractions are	0
So now Has anybody ever made	0
Now you need to do what Peter is doing	0
So when were drawing threes and sixes it is a little bit confusing on how we draw it	0
This B	0
So for example for segment bisector which is what we just did down here you would write in the quick definition like the sentence that we just wrote on our page and then you would write in the same picture	0
Just a whiteboard marker	0
And then try to say it in your words	0
In the hundredths	0
How do I scale down	0
I want you on journal page 65	0
Weve learned traditional addition and traditional subtraction	0
Yes	0
Thats your equivalent factor	0
They stayed the same as the original measures of variation	0
Three times two is six so 13 would be two sixths which is really close to a half	0
Every part of this fraction has a denominator of four	0
I added them together and I got 70 so I did 180 minus	0
Thank you	0
It does sound very close to what it means	0
So if youre using a Ti calculator you write the number three and then you find this button	0
So you figured it out	0
And now I just have a simple two step equation to solve	0
You interpreted it the way I did	0
Roge why are you scribbling those out	0
Now share what you did because youre correct	0
Um this part	0
Two hundred and eightyeight	0
What	0
I dont change this	0
7 8 9 10 11	0
Do not do the bottom	0
This will have It has a tip so just use it	0
Youve got your purple return pumps that youve been working on	0
Diagram D	0
That took Isaiah like really looking at that division ladder and figuring out what like giving you a little bit of feedback	0
So lets take a look at this sheet	0
You actually could use some of what Mark did to explain that	0
And and then breaking apart	0
Stop	0
Please go down	0
And notice when you actually add those back up you still do get your 500	0
Very very happy	0
2x3 is 6	0
Oh	0
Mr Michael Im going to have you go ahead and start us out	0
Ive gotta do it	0
Could we just draw something	0
No	0
Then the last one that I like to do is to multiply by 10	0
So in this problem when I divide two by three I get zero wholes and then I get this pattern of numbers that starts to develop	0
r being any number on the bottom	0
This is where youre going to get your stickers if you get oneSanswer correct okay	0
Nope	0
Okay	0
inaudible right now but his answers 512ths	0
Showdown	0
All right	0
No	0
Youre not even counting	0
Guys lets come back together	0
And then I got the eleven fifths and I just added inauidble and it was 21	0
Thats eight	0
Happy birthday	0
What you are going to do is you re going to write on your slates the decimal in word form	0
We need to figure out how much in one set	0
Right	0
So youre tellling me that instead of the one orange and one red  we have two oranges and two reds in this model	0
Okay	0
Thats the right number	0
Oh you guys I know youre better at mental math than I am	0
Missy thank you for showing us your work	0
36	0
I need to see a number model	0
A couple of you have some really awesome models to show that	0
Take off when everybody agrees that all answers are correct	0
Oh no Im need to draw	0
Then you know what Im going to give a couple extra here just because I have some extra ones	0
And so in this case the letters I randomly pick were a x and Q doesnt matter at all what the letters are	0
But it is to do with a right angle	0
Yes	0
And lets  just agree as were moving along	0
So success criteria	0
From here to here	0
Okay	0
I shouldnt have to say that	0
You can just write yes or no since you guys are both saying the explanation out loud	0
Because when I line them up they match	0
Half	0
Before we go into why that is were going to have to play around with some outer blocks	0
Im not going to add my whole numbers and fractions	0
Oh you have to minus right	0
Close	0
I had to shovel all of my friends driveways	0
If we did 13 divided by 23 your answer would be 12	0
16 would just be half of 13	0
Use and what am I going to use	0
Is it always going to be	0
Now the head is just for fun	0
He goes I dont know how much of this to buy	0
Good	0
Thank you	0
One 16th	0
Yes	0
You might want to study you might want to study Andrews model  to see what you have to do to make it bigger	0
Okay	0
You could say infinity	0
I want you to prove two things to me	0
Okay	0
Lets try another one	0
Okay so this is actually a yes situation	0
Maybe like a metaphorical tomato	0
Seriously this is what youre supposed to do in the morning	0
All right	0
So the s	0
Its that same situation	0
Im thinking about everything I have to pay for in a month things I need	0
Yes	0
Up until now you have been asked to find a fraction of a whole number	0
Do all three 45 times nine order of operations is important here	0
Plus four more gives me 14	0
So Wade I noticed you circled zero	0
Great lets see it	0
We had to go to 35 chaperones to have enough for all those kids	0
Yes	0
You guys have now shown me in shape	0
Were going to go to the next one	0
Lets look at another STUDENT 1nswer	0
So were going to have 5 circles	0
Youve said 15  16  16	0
Erik We did we did it with Erin we did it with Erin	0
Yes there	0
But to have them now its not comfortable	0
Oh no	0
Come right up here on the floor real quick	0
Bobby I need you to show me your work	0
Youre going to have to do some math here	0
okay to your desks in 5 4 3 2 1 0	0
Okay	0
All right I want you to have a conversation with your partner about how is being solved	0
Yes	0
And then well switch gears well start talking about domain and range	0
So thats page 34	0
You will however need to double check your opponents to make sure theyre not cheating	0
Weve got the square paper over there	0
Okay	0
Thank you	0
I need to take seven and I need to cut it in half	0
Oh I have two different things to	0
Charlotte do you normally work with Adam	0
Why Why Why	0
Well you sort of know it	0
Let s see	0
There you go	0
So if I were to count by fours 4812 16 it is not a factor	0
Okay then everybody lets try thinking about it	0
on this example one of thems going to work and one of thems not going to work	0
Nine	0
Okay awesome	0
So y equals something X plus five	0
Okay catch the brown high knees	0
Right here is my two and a half 25 mark	0
Utilities	0
So now we know the base 1317 lets plug in to our area formula	0
And every single  group has to come up with a guess	0
Is that too loud	0
Thats all I have to say	0
So the reason why you dont need to repeat it	0
Just a minute	0
On a graph this is just going to start at a point and then its going to drop a little bit every time	0
So the inverse operation of minus seven is plus seven plus seven	0
Oh my gosh of course you can	0
Yes	0
Yes no and what do you think why	0
Theres one two three so were going to have to shift three place values	0
If youve got these answered stand up please	0
Show me your work Johnny	0
Okay make sure you write in green paint and were going to set up a ratio table	0
How many tabs  in all and then well talk about how we got our answers	0
So if it doesnt constant a multiplier then it will go to zero	0
Please	0
Go when youve got all three of these done stand up push your chair in	0
Puberty	0
Now the objective is to use your fraction circles	0
I saw some of you some of your dry erase boards were covered with math but I couldnt tell where your steps were so multisteps you want to list your steps you take to solve the problem	0
Annalise leave that alone please	0
Suppose I took those  it s the question you just asked you might want to write the  volume this down	0
So if you turn it into an improper fraction because otherwise	0
The run is three	0
We need to pass	0
You have this negative symbol there	0
Now if you know what I mean by incremental fours its eight times one is eight but eight times four is 32 and then eight time is eight which would be four levels down is 64	0
Perfect no worries	0
So some of you have been looking You wrote some comments that you were like Im not sure about this	0
In the mathematical tables this number Pi has other decimal places	0
Because it could be an  I  or an  h	0
Im gonna move groups	0
Russell thats a whole number	0
Yes you put them in the document	0
Because its a really good habit to get into to figure these things out	0
Yes	0
Math message Im just gonna put math message	0
So we learned how to label you just add points and things to label them	0
You sure	0
Just like this	0
Its not a function	0
There are three steps to this strategy	0
And I looked at I looked at  what he built here to represent some of the  story and I thought by looking at this model that I couldnt really tell  of the boy and the girl who was taller by looking at them I wasnt  really sure and I didnt know really if Mark cared about that	0
Think about whether it matches your background and what you know about subtracting fractions or subtraction in general	0
All right	0
Reagan	0
Oh dear	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
And I only have three cans of food	0
So were going to move to slide number three	0
Draw a picture and think about an equation	0
I called on three different people to solve that	0
Professor Gunnar  Gjone is from Oslo Norway and  he is here to see what we are  doing	0
Okay	0
All right and then nine over three is just three for your slope	0
Its a hard one	0
This is a sample answer but this would be	0
But I only have one thing that Im dividing	0
No please	0
Dont second guess your work	0
I forgot to add the person whos like the first person	0
Okay	0
I guess what I would like you all to  think about for the next time we come is how you can  convince me if you think you can what two divided by two  thirds is	0
Yeah	0
Then on the next page we have Jake is designing a picture for the cover of his reading folder	0
And so I think a good guess as rhombus because it really does look like rhombus but we dont know for certain	0
So this is what I have to diagnose when I go through and I look at what you turned in	0
So thats two and three fourths plus one	0
So let me go back to this one	0
Okay	0
Heres all different cases	0
the same	0
He gave us an equivalent decimal	0
And its 410 right	0
Correct	0
Okay	0
Eighteen times	0
Watch my math today	0
I like how you used a variety of the math vocabulary when you described what the trapezoid would look like	0
So thats kind of what Carrie was saying	0
Th e	0
Ok so	0
Number three youre going to write her new ordered pairs	0
Sum the sum of 412ths plus 312ths	0
Thats	0
All right	0
What is ten times five	0
Pause there	0
So what you have to ask yourself is this	0
Then you put me born in the year 18000	0
You got it	0
Im thinking of a number I triple my number then I add three and I end up with 30	0
Thats a consistent rate just like Lewis was saying	0
The third question and I might get the order a little bit wrong	0
So some repeats 86468 theres some repeats	0
Thirty two	0
Then it asked me what are the dimensions of the shaded rectangle	0
Both the same	0
Three two one	0
And think weve already done this once and I told you this we already did extended addition facts and weve also written in expanded form	0
Speak up	0
Now youre going to come down to 1 2	0
Let me see how good my Asherer works today	0
it would have really been five six and then if you look at it that way	0
If you believe you could go into a breakout room and have a conversation with a partner or two and do problems two three and four in your math journals together	0
In all I have 3 45 containers of jelly	0
No were just doing seven times eight to start	0
And that is going to be important because this is going to have something to do with your homework	0
So these are equal	0
Turn around and face the class dont look at me	0
Good job	0
A to the zero power equals one	0
Writing Im confused in the chat	0
Welcome	0
Put your name on there	0
Let me switch over to my presentation again	0
Here is an example	0
Any va any variable that you use	0
124	0
So this says to find the quotient mentally	0
Keep your answer to yourself and Ill show you the image one more time	0
What would	0
We have class on day six right	0
I just second guessed myself	0
Is that right	0
I  asked you	0
Everybody needs to make sure they have page one	0
So now were on the sixth person	0
Okay	0
Were trying to figure out what 14 is equal to	0
You dont need to bring books tomorrow okay	0
Check yours	0
We have a new way that were going to do homework	0
Lets advance	0
And and yeah this will probably take will probably like 10 to 15 minutes and then Ill try to wrap up class and get you out of here a couple minutes early	0
number four number five Id say the two most important things on here number five or number four sorry your chapter five test is on Thursday December 17	0
You dont need to solve these problems	0
you are going to be using one of these models as you are showing your work	0
Okay	0
Well trade	0
So I subtracted six from the top and one from the bottom	0
If youve been doing this youre should have all this work on your sheet	0
Some of you are now getting started	0
That is why Im asking you to show your work	0
You guys are better at that than me	0
Its really good	0
Okay give us some logic and some justification	0
So it would be 800000	0
So in order for this to be a right triangle one of these angles would have to be right	0
No distractions	0
Okay	0
Erase your boards clean	0
Excuse me	0
Okay so is this a function now heres how you test if its a function you can look in here to see if theres any repeats for x I dont see any repeats for x we have zero	0
And that lets me know that this segment from here to here is the same as this segment from here to here	0
Im going to give you your little half sheet	0
There you go so I want you to do that all the way down	0
Michael you had it right	0
Lets put a puzzle together	0
Theyre really easy to get if you know how to do it	0
I want to hear you talking about this right now	0
Okay	0
I want to hear from you guys	0
So its no different	0
Thank you	0
One two three four five six seven 18	0
He did it	0
The first one use fraction circles or the number line poster to solve this problem on your slate	0
I see these bigbrained fourth graders with your synapses and neurons firing in your brains electricity passing from the left side your brain to the right side of your brain back and forth and back and forth creating new memory nodes	0
And youre going to be working through these in a small group today in just a few minutes	0
We already have four	0
No because five divided by 15 equals	0
It looks like Im sorry I have a terrible search history here	0
Remember the first step is to label now want to see every single person in here label x one y 1x two y two a promise its such a help When you use this equation if you label Okay that way you just you literally just look at where the numbers are	0
So our first problem is about soccer	0
No	0
So just be aware of that linear pair	0
G for grouping E for exponents M for multiplication division from left to right whichever one comes first were going to do first and S for subtraction	0
One two three	0
You may use a grid or expanded form to help you decide be ready to explain how you know	0
And Andrew I see built it	0
You dont need your calculator right now	0
That should be zero	0
Turn this way	0
When you are done you and your partner should start playing doggone decimal	0
Thats a good idea	0
Okay then you just	0
If it would help you to make the new coordinates get going	0
6 divided by three	0
It does not mean 4 x 2	0
Blue	0
Um and we are going to rename mixed numbers and fractions greater than one by composing and breaking apart wholes	0
And because we wanted two years we did 576 plus 576 and we got our final answer of 1152 eggs	0
Somebody somebody could have pulled out the same tile that somebody else already	0
So we have two fractions	0
I love the people that are actually writing down the information Im doing on the board	0
Okay keep going	0
Yes I completed some problems but I should think I can get at least a seven and a half	0
Its been thinking and if thinking too much Just a second	0
I could come up with for that one no	0
We always want to it to make sense and if it doesnt try again	0
Well have ones and threes	0
Now I want to look at something like	0
each that is 60 more marbles out of our total	0
Ok Could you give out these for me Jackie to the tables	0
This is yours for being an amazing teacher and this is yours for being an amazing student who was willing to relearn	0
Well there was a lot of interesting things discussed	0
You can come	0
So just know that	0
People thinking about factors	0
Can I explain mine	0
This one though is called the function notation	0
Ok lets see  more hands	0
And then you should get that green shape then too	0
on our team	0
Clothing	0
Yeah	0
One times negative two is negative two	0
Because thats pretty much what it is	0
How many do you want him to put in	0
Good job	0
See if you can write your equation	0
Okay	0
Nope	0
All right	0
Here youve got these wonderful examples	0
Okay	0
I agree	0
Now I would like use your fraction circle pieces to solve the problem	0
Look at what they have and how could you make the same shape they have without using four triangles or two rhombuses	0
Yes so you only have to fill it in into the equation	0
You dont need to sit there	0
Hey Jessie the link to the Pear Deck is in there	0
Uh huh	0
What could you use that for	0
All right	0
Maybe this is a model that doesnt use the Cuisenaire rods but in a  sense its a model	0
Awesome	0
But the only breakout rooms Im going to do are those that believe they know how to do one or the other division	0
Youve got an account	0
Yes	0
I have that too	0
Yep right there	0
So I have 16 divided by 4 or 1 and six tenths divided by 4 tenths	0
Everyone take a seat	0
Me and Maya were partners	0
And this one is a negative slope over here	0
Let me pick light pink this time	0
Because the surface area of the square is five	0
Julia Zach Kim and Matt Kerr	0
I did	0
You want to rub here	0
Where to put one tenth	0
And this should look familiar six over two which is what we had over here because the rise was six the run was two six over two which is equal to three	0
Are you done	0
Awesome	0
Fraction pieces	0
Im going to have you guys go ahead and put your pencil in page 60 close page 60 and were going to look at this first problem of 12 34 and 8 34	0
Here	0
I want to find out what this is	0
Lets play fraction of	0
Why am I having you do so much talking	0
Okay	0
I didnt multiply	0
This part we dont actually need	0
So its got this backwards here	0
No you have to stay on this coordinate Felicia Y coordinate	0
So to minus it so its closest to half inauidble	0
Okay so sorry we dont do this with our masks	0
So this is one that I didnt really think of but totally works	0
I have two two two one one one one two two one two one one two one two one two one one two one one two	0
One more time	0
So boys and girls probably what you want to do is highlight the important information	0
Then they would digest it	0
Sorry Kimber	0
In front of you are our shapes	0
We need to go out side	0
You dont have to cross off what you did	0
In other words	0
Divide it	0
So your equation is x equals negative four	0
Yeah we dont have to use a specific person okay	0
Maybe they didnt use a ruler	0
So you can you can write on that map just not in pen	0
Okay	0
We ll talk	0
Other than that everybody have a great afternoon	0
Now she could be in her mind doing this Okay I have four and then I added another four and another four and another four	0
College students in Santa Barbara California completed classes and are making travel plans to go home for the summer	0
Just a minute	0
thats 13 now I need one sixth	0
For some of you you need to practice being organized about showing your steps and for some of you theres a lot of things we might need to work on	0
I started out with a half	0
Okay	0
Make sure theyre talking about place value of the number and how it becomes a whole versus the 10ths hundredths 1000ths Okay	0
Audience	0
Lets make sure that our circles also	0
Okay	0
One two three four five six seven eight nine	0
Then I have to do minus	0
Once youve finished this problem youre going to check with me and then you can move on to imagine and get some lessons passed	0
Starts with a V	0
You will be creating number problems writing them out	0
Thanks Pedro	0
When you are doing 5 divided by 4 you can write it Make sure youre looking at my screen as just 5 divided by 4	0
We are going to do a quick review of our work	0
Absolutely	0
I draw this length twice eh three times next to each other	0
Now for the 500ths	0
So you guys can solve it you just cant explain it	0
You could get two from this one and  two from this one and two from this one and two from this  one	0
Yes it does	0
Look at your little guy	0
Thumb up if you have an answer with who has the most money	0
Wait what if it went this side	0
Thats a good guess to start	0
So well have something left over	0
inaudible That was the last dot	0
I think you will	0
Unitary or fraction	0
See if you look up there it says feedback helps me improve	0
So two times wider and the same height	0
Okay it covers one half	0
A lot of more sense	0
Y equals put that one up front	0
Feeling good I can make my combinations I can fill this up	0
Okay	0
Yes rememberin  larger than this one you dont really need to do that	0
Thats a  very very nice notation	0
How many enclosed in the bag	0
Keep reviewing	0
So now were going to go back and we are going to move forward to introduction	0
I will know I am successful when I can explain how my drawing or paperfoldedmodel is a representation of a fraction product	0
And I know you all have them because my dear sweet mommy cut them out so that you each had your own	0
You know I have to tell you that I enjoyed our snow day yesterday	0
Im glad my middle schoolers know that means you paid attention to fourth grade	0
Youll see	0
We are not messing with partial sums	0
Yes	0
This is our original now we have our modified ones were going to which we are manipulating ourselves	0
Three  sixths	0
This ones going up from left to right	0
Friends the response that is corrected one two three four sentences at least	0
And Im going to ask for some help reading these	0
Nicely done	0
So remember that when we talk about the bigger denominator and smaller pieces thats when our numerators are the same	0
This is what you did	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Uh huh	0
This is undefined slope	0
Throughout the lesson today you are going to be making sure that you are enlarging things to make them better	0
The one thats the next  largest	0
If this was a dollar it would be one whole dollar	0
Come on down	0
All right	0
Thank you	0
So key point being here when you are taking a whole away from the actual whole number its not a 10 its only the denominator	0
Six 12ths	0
You know what I like is that Miller shared and I saw people nodding	0
Okay you guys this is your warm up	0
And if you look at the equation we figured out seven eighths is the biggest	0
Number five where youre  restaurant	0
Move it to the right	0
You need to add those together	0
Just change the rest of your equation	0
When you are done I would like you to turn in your papers and you may work on math boxes if you havent finish with your partner	0
Now to get 27 over here I multiplied the 3  9	0
I am going to Let me look at the page that its going to have you complete and I want to make sure that its what I want and not change it	0
Because I know that 20 plus 6 is 26	0
It makes no sense	0
You dont have to rewrite the entire question again	0
I just picked this is the scale	0
So we automatically know that if I do this process first I can figure this out	0
Thanks Rylee	0
Can fit in the bag	0
Let me catch up with you	0
Not right	0
And all I have to add four plus three this is seven plus thats where those numbers come in	0
Lets see what you come up with	0
Uhh huh	0
Thats what it should look like	0
Before we move on I want you to keep in mind that our objective for the day was that I can use US traditional multiplication to multiply two digits by one digit	0
Okay	0
I think theyre all kind of related to calculators	0
This way or that way	0
Yes	0
Perfect	0
If you found the denominator as 100 you did hundredths try tenths	0
So youre going to finish that page	0
Thesearea models	0
And were going to practice  using this formula a couple of times three times a	0
So not days	0
Sandra clip up	0
Exactly	0
This is what were going to do	0
Okay	0
Can I guess the answer	0
And then I want you to draw 12 slashes 12 slashes just like that	0
Its an algorithm	0
No	0
Lets plug in what we know	0
Then three keys to success	0
So this ones missing an explanation	0
Three times four	0
This is the whole	0
This is different for us	0
Have a look uh at the equations	0
Okay	0
I remember that	0
Now whats seven Then you can do this one together	0
Brian you need to be listening honey	0
14 x 45 14 x 45 of Good	0
Someone has to steal the necklace	0
How many	0
All right Reuban finish off that equation and were looking good I think other than that	0
For instance Ill do this one	0
Thank you	0
And then if you want to save yourself some writing time today I really do recommend using the typing pool	0
I know	0
Your 99 in there is 099 it is not the 99	0
Talk talk talk talk talk talk talk	0
and Okay so if did not and Haley I want you to go back and I want you to redo this because this is not an answer that if your understanding what the questions asking you that you got	0
Yes	0
You dont add them together get three and one and You have to remember its wholes and then a fraction	0
If your answers were zero because I dont like eggs	0
It goes to zero because it doubles the zero zero	0
Yes thats fine	0
Thanks for working with me	0
Take out your review pack and find this exact one	0
And now we have to summarize it calculate it and detect that still something more can be factorized here	0
I am okay	0
Thank you so much	0
Im going to ask you Ms	0
Youve said you are going to work with it in a right triangle	0
Its this thing right there you all have it	0
Okay	0
Thanks everybody	0
Youre not doing five divided by four	0
Volume	0
We need to sit down	0
Those are your answer for the first one	0
You can only be fired and I	0
Im seeing some people are not hiding their boards when theyre done	0
You seem like you do go back to your seat please	0
Thank you Mr g	0
Here is why	0
Okay	0
Im going to draw this vertical line here	0
Once you go to Chromebook or once youre in your Factors are on page what	0
You have to use ramp	0
I as the person doing it know I need to double and triple	0
Okay	0
And then if you want to go back and try again youll see its like you just have to the first part is a little tricky but youll see kind of what the trick is hopefully and then and then you can do those parts	0
Im just going to do some answering	0
What s the bad thing about keeping secrets	0
Almost done	0
I want you guys to do this on your paper	0
Thanks for laughing at least a little bit	0
So there was some discussion about that	0
So thats three parts and theres 16 parts total	0
But suppose we choose to go down	0
For ATT when its per text message then its really for every text message its three cents	0
And youre going to open the 191	0
So a factor times a factor equals a product	0
Different denominators	0
You can do the same thing 162 and Michael for you is that You found it  easily	0
I finish this page first right	0
Can it also be in the hundreds	0
Okay	0
Its from the pencil sharpener	0
I think I said to 21 but I meant to 22	0
If you need help you can always come to the table but I really want you to try it on your own for a little bit	0
I want you to really understand why both of your strategies work which is awesome	0
Its already here	0
So this is what were going to do if you are in MathLand youre going to clap on every other beat	0
I ve seen a lot of L shapes	0
Yes	0
So then I just look at the numerators	0
Then and so people who havent written this here write it and then do problem one	0
Okay	0
This one is 43 of a block and if you need anything else clarified please let me know	0
Now remember this is where it gets tricky	0
Okay	0
You want to work with a partner	0
What I hear you say is that You mind if I write on your desk	0
Okay so I want us to go back to an example of what a function is	0
Yep	0
Now put your dry erase or caps on	0
Okay round to the nearest hundredth	0
All right there we go	0
I have three wholes there and if they each have eight pieces that would be 24 pieces the size of 18	0
I trust you Im trusting you	0
The we have to scale that up to 105	0
But your first part is correct	0
Number one	0
Switch it	0
Nice	0
No zeros in this one 38 x 33	0
Right	0
Ordered value bar graph is one way we can find the mean and the algorithm is the other way	0
Give yourselves a tap on the back that was great mathematical theme if thats how we would say it	0
So if the denominators are not the same you just have to go through one more step	0
Plus we have to add one more fourth to have 134	0
Thats why some people like light ice or no ice in their drinks because then you get more liquid	0
Use the grid to help you decide	0
These two parts that are left over are two of the three parts that are needed when we divide	0
Coordinate grid	0
What Im going to say is I need to borrow one whole here	0
I need your eyes up here please	0
Yup someone else needs to solve	0
But any point that is not a starting or stopping point is vance point	0
Is it hard for you guys to see the board in the back	0
All right come back to the shared screen	0
So your picture though really nicely modeled why you have 16 leftover good job	0
I want you to look at what you to look at what I have done here	0
And then I want to show you one that does not work	0
But heres my question	0
Thats kind of what I expect	0
In  your notebook  Were not sharpening pencils right now guys	0
This ones half	0
rectangle	0
Per is for every	0
Someone told me that when I was  walking around it might have been Audra	0
So itd be between five and six	0
So thats how our model would look different if were representing the size of group versus the number of groups	0
Thats the closest we can get to one half	0
Y intercept for this one There is no y intercept	0
Okay	0
Good	0
No but if you say like Juliana said we make our denominator five because we know it takes five marbles to make a full sack but we dont have five we only have three thats why it becomes a fraction	0
Its that simple	0
Yes	0
Some of them I did	0
Right	0
Do you have a twin a double a queen or a kingsized bed or a California kingsized bed	0
Because 23 is when if you take away third its 13	0
How many of you did it that way in one meter you have  three thirds so in the nine meters you have a total of nine  thirds  you have three one thirds another three one thirds  and another three one thirds	0
Right	0
All golf claps are quiet	0
Yes so in this case were talking about the perimeter	0
Okay nice job	0
Thats what you multiply by	0
You two are going to be partners	0
No	0
She told you she was  today	0
Linda	0
We already did some of these the other day and were going to do them again	0
Okay so Im going to exit that well come back to that go back to this and we are going to our morning message	0
I do and I have it ready right here	0
Zero and one	0
because you guys have to know the P section as well	0
Were showing Nadia active listening you know we expect from each other	0
Can you tell	0
Which is 15 minus 2 to finish us off please Rachel	0
There you go	0
I know you cant see	0
Crew you are in team mode I want you to remember Cals recommendation when he said to use the phrase Do you agree	0
A substitute symbol a placeholder	0
Thats right	0
Really important that you guys understand that conceptually as well	0
Number one we have a couple of situations	0
Yes you got it	0
x is 5	0
Okay now Id like you to let me double check to make sure this isnt in your math book	0
I only need a little bit more to get to 172	0
So they multiply this side by two and they multiply that side by two	0
Look at section one	0
There may be ones from your own group	0
Date	0
Do what Hadley added here and tell me who is correct	0
Agree	0
And each question is going to be kind of set up the same way	0
Then 1 square	0
I had a lot of people doing tens	0
You need to open your Chromebook	0
Okay	0
Okay so notes for this section	0
All right	0
Okay	0
These are wrong here	0
Ive got mine calibrated  10 degrees higher	0
Laura	0
So list the first six	0
We d like to thank you very nicely done  up front	0
Now you can sum them together	0
I want you to make a bar graph with your group displaying this information	0
If yours are not lined up just rewrite them	0
Youre just doing the estimate and the answer	0
Dont Submit	0
Hey Shyanne come here	0
Friends that is US traditional multiplication	0
Haven thinks shes confident that she knows what shes doing	0
And our learning intention today is I can discuss strategies for multiplying fractions by whole numbers	0
Okay	0
Their answer was absolutely correct so very nice job and I appreciate that you are able to explain your thinking	0
Yes	0
Theres a lot of steps in this	0
If you would like to sit on the floor and work from there	0
Write a rule that Jake can use to make the picture of the book larger	0
We can find a common denominator between one and three	0
With this you got one	0
Were going to use algebra and multiple trees	0
And then youre going to divide that by five which is 45 divided by five	0
Yes	0
There we go	0
Yes I didnt	0
So I can say that 8 yerts will accommodate 48 campers	0
To make a this	0
Okay so those are all the ways you can find your slope	0
So Im going to grab the sticks in just a minute	0
Part of our Mac is that we can model it show it explain it	0
Eva ate half of it so this is gone now I got half then Or Eva took half of it then she only ate two 23 so that was my second folding	0
Awesome	0
So S is zero comma five	0
So first of all this is the y intercept which is zero comma three	0
Hi Julia	0
Erik I dont think thats what Michael said  though	0
Nope	0
Four twelfths	0
Hey my friends you are going to stop	0
Were down to 20	0
Fraction of might be 18 of 20	0
Way off	0
So heres D and I dont want to write it	0
Go for it	0
I just dont understand why its not moving	0
Why dont you  but youre not working on the guesses	0
Do we do all of these	0
You need to find the school on your map and then you need to find the grocery store	0
Okay so we did that	0
The rock	0
I went backwards by four thirds	0
Lucky	0
Yes	0
Duncan turn your mic on for me	0
Yes	0
We arrived at this when we are talking	0
Let me write that a little bit neater actually	0
Im going to have you when I say go put your homework in a place that you will be able to find it	0
Everybody is going to get a game board	0
Is the other thing on the bottom supposed to be on	0
This is positive slope	0
You shouldnt do that every time	0
Wow Zach	0
Try it	0
Heres where things get a little bit tricky	0
I always think about food	0
Yeah the pattern  to understand	0
Thats good	0
Yes youre going to get really oily	0
Okay	0
Oh	0
Those of you in Mathland we are going to go into break out groups in just a minute Im going to get you guys started in just a minute so just hang tight	0
Table two do you want to be completely done with this	0
Okay	0
Run run run the line	0
This isnt correct	0
Ill give you some time to think about it and then well share out your thinking because its vitally important that you think about Where did I come up with this answer and why does it make sense or why does it not make sense	0
Pairs	0
And since A C is 160 half is 80	0
What problems do we have to do now 14	0
And each number is a population	0
So its not about like going up a hill or anything	0
We all make mistakes but when youre fighting and arguing with the person that can prove it and tell you where you made your mistake that is where you have to back off because heres what I know for a fact	0
Just to save us a little bit of effort were going to round this down to approximately 3963	0
The king ran out of sealable pouches	0
Eh Mr can we watch the video sometime	0
Shayla right here	0
Dont yell out	0
Okay	0
Its an even jump every time	0
So were going back to equivalent fractions	0
Yeah good for you	0
Oh	0
Please write the following problemand tell me who can answer it	0
Okay	0
I heard a couple of things	0
Theyre different things that were adding	0
And for the second one I wrote It would look like a book but much much bigger wider and longer	0
Because regularly three plus four equals seven	0
Six times seven	0
Please do your drawing and solve the problem	0
Dont be afraid to doodle this out	0
30 x 20	0
So were going to be looking at a lot of tables graphs and equations today	0
I heard somebody say my mom explained something to me a certain way and Ive heard the word was like I did it this way	0
Because I think thats more than enough information to start it	0
That gives 12 equals 2x divided by two divided by two I get x equals six for that	0
Lets just wait so that will be working theres not talking	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Yeah	0
So put your division line	0
I want to do it	0
The perimeter	0
Are you okay	0
We need to do the inverse operation or the opposite of plus six which is minus six to both sides	0
Now I want to try something	0
Okay but this is not a strategy that everybody loves and its not the easiest strategy for everyone	0
Everyone will go up there to do it	0
So you might be thinking to yourself Well why didnt we just look at the graph for this	0
And then we work backwards really adding twos we get two and then four still works for the pattern	0
Last year I worked really hard with some of my students to put these together into our baggies and then mine got taken away and we got we just got like a pile of them	0
Well I dont know if it would really work	0
Youre right	0
See I can see quickly you havent even finished graphing these yet so I want you to do the quickwrite right now	0
You dont need to shuffle it just doesnt Josher that much	0
Now people sitting in table number two	0
Eileen will you take the microphone with you	0
You got it	0
Erase your boards clean	0
Mason you have to try	0
The last one	0
You together are going to find another name for each fraction or mixed number without changing the denominator without changing the denominator	0
Okay	0
Thats another way to think about parentheses	0
Heres your eagle back	0
Beautiful	0
And I even have kids when theyre starting multiplication what they do is theyll write that down	0
We have Rose Well done	0
I think that theyre not the same because of the amount of each number	0
And then they put brackets	0
The negative of negative guy matches the positive thing perfect	0
Two lets do with three right here	0
So when you guys are explaining you need to make sure that your words are precise and that you are using math vocabulary	0
Then I did 3 6020 and then I did 20x240	0
So your shoulder partner has to be the one on your right	0
Kill someone	0
Okay	0
Tomorrow you re going to be doing a seesaw explaining to your parents how to do partial products	0
Okay	0
I want you to think to yourself for just a minute	0
Then you already have an idea as to which ones they are	0
Okay we can skip it come back to it	0
Okay	0
and I will tell you that there   will be more than one number that might work here	0
Okay	0
Okay we can wait	0
A mixed number our numerator is bigger than our denominator I ate a whole pizza plus some more	0
And you get 44	0
I have one for you	0
I will know Im successful when I use  of fractions circle pieces to solve problems two point	0
And then 120 times  and then you have to divide 1200 by six and you have to divide 6X by six to get	0
Okay so you multiply by negative two and you add nine lets just check one or two	0
Let me take the one off the agenda	0
Yes	0
And then this is your y intercept over here as well	0
You guys come on	0
I think can I think I can I know I can	0
If you finish four five and six go to math boxes and wait patiently to check with a partner in a second	0
Groups of four	0
It has all the parts of a sentence that we need but its wrong	0
Here are a couple of things to think about	0
And Ryder I love how youre writing your equation for that one	0
This half is the pizza that I have	0
Thats all it asked me to do was draw five by eight rectangle	0
The list of problem solving strategies that you just discussed are your resources	0
Okay	0
Oh so it wouldnt be A cubed over B cubed	0
Anyone else need one	0
Its too late	0
That could be 75	0
Try number one all by yourself when youre done pencils down	0
OkaySSright	0
Joe I cannot recommend you do calculus if you cannot spell calculus right	0
Well I know the answer but I dont really know how to explain it but its You skip count	0
Okay cool	0
We must write them down	0
You could if you wanted to	0
Right one down four	0
Because 3  12  15	0
35 25 15	0
So now that we know what prime and composite numbers are how	0
Okay so go ahead	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
You guys have your papers	0
So one of the things that I want to kind of highlight here is this term modeling	0
Can you look at my score cuz i dont know if i still should work with you	0
I put my answer	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
First thing youre going to do is in your math workbook so go ahead and get out your math workbook and turn to page 201	0
Very close	0
And we were discussing which of these two diagrams might help present this information more clearly for a 4th grade class	0
Be careful when you are multiplying and do not miss any terms or else it will be wrong	0
No this looks like a tent	0
Okay	0
And then I added 12 plus 12 to get 24	0
When you have the second one there 43 if you can figure out why it will also work there	0
All right so now I want you to listen to the description they were looking for okay because these were the mathematical terms that I didnt hear	0
So that five is worth 50	0
My smallest amount to my largest amount	0
Um	0
Good question	0
Were fine were just going to leave that	0
Yeah	0
You got it	0
You dont have to do it exactly the way I do though	0
Okay	0
A line plot starts with a line	0
Now lets go to Haven	0
Thats not how your age works	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Just a second	0
How many times larger does it want	0
All right	0
Good job	0
Speak now if youre still writing down the numbers	0
Interesting	0
Yes	0
I just dropped here 282 135	0
Its tricky to know when do I put a percent sign there	0
Because if you do 5 x 100 you get 500 and 500 is bigger than 260	0
We have one more	0
Yeah	0
Lets look at your number seven	0
Your equation is correct	0
And that would give it another whole	0
Yeah	0
All right	0
So here is what I would like for you and your partner to do	0
Now we re certainly not going to solve that today but I ll bet you you are going to solve it in the next few weeks	0
Each pizza in this situation is going to get 14 of a block of cheese	0
You don t have to answer it now	0
Yes that is the same story actually	0
Here we go	0
Neatly	0
Okay	0
Wait no	0
Yes you have your aStudentsignments	0
Thats why I showed you guys before you left so you could see it	0
You have to be listening to how they did it	0
Stop with numbers	0
Write an equation for that	0
Its going to be easier that way you guys can turn them in together	0
And understand using that multiplication to help me solve my division	0
Threefourths of a bag of eight carrots	0
Just divide my wholes into fourths and then Ill circle groups of 34	0
What do we do with the one	0
Because if you have two radical x plus one you can just go for x plus one you can distribute that exponent because theres not separated by this	0
See if I can make it choke me	0
Dont erase	0
The word equivalent that we know is the word equal	0
Theyre not equivalent	0
Now once youve gotten all you can you bring in Judi	0
so Im curious to know whether you succeeded in making this type of equation alongside a graph	0
Should we go from zero to one	0
And congratulations to those of you who were able to adjust your thinking by listening to other students	0
That is correct and what the  that would be correct is count up all the data points he got 20 and then he would have to count 10 and then would do the next phase for  and because its even 20 is then we have to do the next phase but if it was odd we would have to do the next number	0
Thats nine blocks away	0
That 210 yen is applied to this 200 yen you know	0
Thats a big increase	0
The contents of the wallet	0
All right here we go 34 110 26 1112 and 52100	0
You dont need this	0
Theres going to be some more mean in there as well	0
So write out A six As	0
Okay so lets work on that	0
So heres why its a function is because if I start all the way over here and I move this line over my red line with with blue dots on it it only crosses at one point at a time	0
I dont want to say it I think that some of you feel so confident in adding that that you think you dont need to rewrite it but you absolutely must rewrite it	0
Then you can see we didnt make a mistake for any of the other steps	0
That would work okay	0
No	0
Were gonna say similar similar by angle angle similarity	0
Yes they both equal 24 so think about how you can represent 24 in the way that the problem is asking us to	0
Now try at least one more of five	0
Oh nice	0
Awesome	0
Lets start with number one	0
Were looking at our desk were looking at our hands were fidgeting with things	0
I have a question	0
And what I am going to make sure of is that you just know how to divide	0
Okay so now your white board	0
journal	0
We should be looking at an answer	0
It certainly must be important since it occurs more than once	0
I have to find that common denominator and you said its 24	0
Because were multiplying	0
You should know the number	0
Weve done this before	0
Bodyboards	0
Awesome	0
I lied	0
Well here s what you can do	0
And Im going to tell why	0
You dont need to write this down	0
Yes we do	0
Right equals 120	0
When you multiply a whole number by a fraction thats less than one its always going to make your whole number smaller	0
Hey	0
Just leave the word identity okay	0
Were going to break down our teams	0
Its okay	0
Oh that s very nice	0
Right	0
See what we come up with	0
Welcome	0
One is like really struggling	0
our equation then is going to be 20x plus five	0
The slope is negative three over one	0
Plus if you really spend some time thinking about the practice test and learning from your mistakes youre gonna do even better on the test tomorrow	0
We are going to look at what youre doing today	0
we will know why fractions have common denominators when youre adding or subtracting	0
so you can like I said earlier buff out any of those identities that you walked in the hallway going Cosine cosine sine sine as you were walking down the hall memorizing those	0
Were going to practice this skill so we can go	0
And leaving the second pretty much	0
But based on what you said the next one is true because for every 1 cup of white paint there are 3 tablespoons of blue paint	0
You have to get both correct this morning but I still have quite a few	0
Like Adam  said	0
Okay	0
First were going to finish the quiz and we have our lovely tutors that will be able to help us do that	0
Oops thats okay	0
The mic is not on	0
Okay	0
Thanks	0
But youre exactly right	0
Im not even going to read it because	0
Number two	0
26 lines	0
Okay heres what I need to see	0
So Dean is raising money for charity	0
Im going to round up so Im going to subtract six	0
But its one of these algebra one topics that you have to cover its so important to know what a function is	0
So the way that Im going to take these papers is Im going to take them per partnership so that when Im looking at one I know I dont have to look at both	0
Wait no thats right	0
So I know that 15 times five equals 75	0
So right now on a piece of paper I want you to write down the fraction one half	0
Okay do you all believe number from one to five I got this Mrs Mr Strathom	0
In my math bin	0
So keep doing the rest	0
All right write down what you think for this one and then Im going to hear from four people for this one	0
One	0
Thats our rise over our run	0
So lets see seven how many times have seven go into 63	0
Again private think time	0
Okay	0
Well	0
Uhhuh	0
You can work with people at your team but thats it	0
Right	0
Were getting pictures	0
You need to keep it balanced so you always know how much money you have	0
Yeah so that is just a coincidence	0
Great work buddy	0
All right Angela you can work with um Eun and all right	0
Lets try these next two	0
Yeah that was that was stated in the in the problem too that they were equally matched	0
Down 6	0
Adam Haley why are your cameras not on	0
You need to do the math	0
So if the average American eats 25 pounds of bananas a year and there are 25 students in our class	0
Yes	0
I would like everyone to write down onehalf for your first number sentence	0
I did not have Eagle Bucks Im so sorry	0
I think you are going to have to go back to log in to Silver Creek Elementary so that you can get to your dashboard	0
either recognize a first a second or a third binomial formula	0
Thank you for asking	0
And thats 35	0
First you calculated the diagonal of a surface and then by taking this diagonal you have with the height of the box you have found the length of the diagonal of the box	0
Hold on dont start writing yet	0
So A cubed times	0
Were going to do some in class	0
Now write it in the product of 10	0
Charlie so do A and then the other is B	0
Remember you put ice in a cup its taking up space	0
Okay	0
Part of being efficient is youre doing it quickly and correctly	0
Sarah was a student	0
But thats okay	0
If you	0
I bet you can invent a rule that  works Alan	0
Okay I found out yesterday that we are recycling the markers that are used up and dried up	0
So were going to scoot ahead here to our very last problem for the day	0
You can recycle the papers if you want	0
Helping me use my number line to explain how I can figure out whos taller	0
Just use what we have  Theres only two of you  now	0
Um three	0
Okay	0
Thank you	0
Okay Zoe Im having a really hard time understanding you	0
Its one Kleenex its a whole	0
One two three	0
On the form that looks like on the side the one	0
I dont want to die	0
Okay	0
All right	0
Okay thats 10	0
Okay	0
You dont need homescreen	0
So we have half of Larrys fruit bar	0
You arent going to infect your sister are you	0
Everyone should be at their seats	0
All right good	0
Do we need to bring our books	0
Yeah put both of the numbers in	0
again	0
You were like Uh but then as soon as I gave you the actual problem the improper fraction you were able to say I know what I did	0
What helps me is a fraction	0
write an expression to model the number story	0
Okay	0
Okay so then I give them those 123123123123123	0
So Im asking a question I want you to look at what he did in the second one	0
This is two thirds by two thirds	0
The next person that will be leaving will be Marcoua	0
Okay	0
So if we were looking for the three fourths then we would look at the benchmarks and say Well which one is it closer to	0
Im not going to tell you what the answer is but Im going to tell you thats the trickiest one	0
And now its especially great because xs are going to cancel out	0
Okay so Im going to ask a question	0
Okay	0
I can get you another one	0
How many pizzas are there	0
We have to do times a three	0
I heard I heard a couple of different answers	0
Okay all right so you guys did a great job	0
Let me give you the microphone	0
Okay	0
So actually surface area is the same as that side squared	0
Lets try it by four	0
I understand	0
Some of them you might only find one equivalent and thats okay	0
So its not really whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top	0
So I kind of added mine but I separated the wholes from the fractions and I did two minus one equals one and then I did one six one minus 4 equals 3 and then we add it to the sixths so it equals one and three sixths	0
I said 23rds because 23rds is bigger than one half	0
All right	0
I just did	0
Okay lets check the result	0
So you absolutely positively	0
We have 172 students	0
Dr  Fransblau I didn t see your hand up	0
Kevin Im old Ive been doing this for a long time	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
Briar on strike one	0
So this says think fast	0
Without starting there is nothing	0
All three numbers have to be different	0
No its not	0
Yep I did	0
So you should have two nouns	0
Think back to these problems	0
Well lets go back and make sure we have it	0
Not a model an expression	0
So in this problem the domain is 01234	0
I m going to have you quietly bring your journals back over to the carpet	0
Five isnt the fifth digit Its actually the sixth	0
If you have a mic  make sure its on	0
I need you write my name	0
And I will tell you guys right now if we do the exact same thing as we just did for this with twotenths we would get twentyone hundredths	0
So I want to go to 100000000000	0
Yes	0
Okay	0
Everybodys going to use their graph paper to show me their work	0
Yes	0
Now	0
We re going to go to this one we re going to skip	0
Okay so next one	0
Good	0
Like may it may say two plus a number then less than	0
You may erase	0
Go ahead	0
So you can say Oh yeah I think that one of them is true	0
About halfway	0
Thank you	0
Some of you share time between families	0
So then I write this	0
Oh man it was close but it was table two	0
I know that that equals 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 one two three four five times 10	0
So what we need to establish now If you need to use the restroom do so	0
Okay	0
I would like someone to help the people who don t  quite see that that s two fourths	0
Ok	0
So youre supposed to find your first eight multiples	0
So I would like you to write us traditional way which is this way and then the partial questions	0
Yeah	0
So let me go to um lets go to someone I havent talked to yet today	0
And thats how we figure them out when we have to write them out	0
Going from one half to two fourths we doubled so we said Hey if we multiply our numerator by two and our denominator by two we can make our equivalent fraction	0
Im going to give you your math homework	0
This is one that youre going to want to memorize like oh yeah I know what 13 is	0
Okay	0
Heres a All right	0
And were missing Matias today	0
Well see Brennan	0
So we divided into five equal parts and then 15 divided by five is dividing 15 into five parts	0
Sixths	0
They reversed it	0
Mr	0
Someone did not clean your desk out on Friday	0
Then she added them all up and came out with seven twenty five	0
But what Erik just told me right  is something about red and white	0
I think that its good that were using the median	0
So this just to remind you	0
So that would be three for every one	0
Were just simply like look at our number line up here John	0
Let me go back to there	0
This one if it was perfect with that extra part it would go in there	0
I subtract 10 from it	0
I did 23 divided by nine so its like I did 9 x 23  6	0
There are those who would prefer to put three decimal point seventyfive	0
Okay	0
All right	0
I want someone else to tell why she did it into fourths	0
I love those	0
Me too	0
like my four arms are the same length no matter how I move it	0
Thats awesome	0
Walk to your desk right now	0
What do we	0
Were trying to figure out this side	0
Mmhmm	0
And then I am going to go back to a share real quick	0
Im pretty sure its the government	0
Whats whiteout	0
Thank you	0
Take a look at your ordering	0
So its just saying three sides are equal and three angles are equal	0
Okay	0
So three tabs	0
A histogram is not a bar graph	0
Okay so Im going to set a timer for three minutes maybe	0
Well check it	0
Positive A here and here	0
No	0
So minus 120 B	0
I dont know	0
What they mean	0
Thank you Liliana thank you Kara thank you Kiana	0
If to my left my number is getting smaller	0
Theyre all the same but that was just an	0
You would use volume	0
Do not actually start solving any of them yet because Im going to show you what I want it to look like tonight	0
No	0
So now look at it how its written	0
Now today we are learning what we call Oh here we go	0
So Miss Genevieve you absolutely did it right with one exception	0
So what numbers do you multiply to get 36	0
Once again going over these math problems is important so all of you can learn	0
I actually love tuna	0
Okay	0
Now look at the fraction	0
Get out of a 15 get out a 110 and then cover the 15 with 110	0
Is it okay	0
And then we had 5 x 4	0
Did anybody think about it this way we know that the question mark is at 610	0
So the width is now 24 units and the length is now 30 units long	0
The radius	0
Then please write in this part okay	0
Okay	0
The rule is to	0
I do	0
Two times will fit	0
All right	0
Okay	0
All right were going to start with me since Im more familiar with the game than Hadley since I dont think Hadley has ever played this before	0
Go ahead and do that	0
I am going to ask you to each write down your height on a sticky note	0
Correct	0
Which is not very practical but he found out one thing that the number	0
So two times A plus B	0
164 and 165	0
So itd be right	0
For those of you who feel like its okay to be talking right now then if we continue to waste time you will be asked to make up the time that we waste tomorrow during lunch	0
You may	0
Yes	0
Now I also know that I need to subtract my 23 from 22	0
I want an equivalent fraction that has a denominator of 12	0
And if you want to draw the pictures	0
As you guys remember we talked about the other day that maybe we are going to have to wait to have snacks until reading time	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Maam I dont have sciSors	0
Well to make it easier for myself I did 365 times six and then 365 time one	0
Okay	0
And lets talk about how we can show this is correct with what we just talked about with perpendicular bisectors	0
All right so thats midpoint	0
All right	0
We have 312 and 12	0
For this one I want us to write both equations with a 180 in it	0
That we write with an example of an equation so thats going to be x  6 so that should be choice A right there	0
Base B	0
Repeat the numbers	0
Excellent work	0
Were going to talk about how we can use ratios to describe different quantities	0
A yoga session is about 200 calories	0
We talked about when you redo your floors or carpets and you have to figure out what the area of the ground there is so that it fits	0
Okay	0
Right	0
I need you guys to sit down	0
And then three and four    and five and six	0
Im going to say 32 coin pouches	0
Well Ive got a lot of people in the chat	0
You cant see back there you guys can move if you need to	0
So Im going to say four seven	0
All right	0
The fact about selecting our class is a mistake	0
Splendid	0
He says what	0
Made it a whole lot easier and then one times X is X	0
When you and your partner are done with rule with new sailboat one you can talk about the rule for new sailboat two and then you can try new sailboat two on your own after you discuss the rule	0
And then you can see weve ended up with five fourths and then you could regroup them to get to one and a fourth like we did here	0
I fixed it	0
Six divided by two is three	0
You have to figure out how much of that pint is going into that bowl	0
Come on	0
They wrote things in words	0
Okay	0
And that is what a lot of your work is going to be today	0
Okay	0
Thats exactly what Brenda and Angie did	0
Yes	0
I think its just a little bit off	0
Hm	0
But then I but then I looked at it more and then I realized that it theyre pretty much the same fractions	0
Divide	0
Last night at homework club Missy had it	0
Great	0
This ones 30	0
Keep going	0
Some of this is going to be super super easy its going to look exactly like what we just did	0
To connect around them	0
1Um yes	0
Its okay not to understand something	0
Let s set it down and Roger s going to get it on the camera here	0
So we know for how many rods for the ladder for one twenty eight steps	0
This is what Sara just said	0
Or just tell him what you did	0
Oh do we on our homework uh	0
Okay	0
I dont	0
Okay	0
All right	0
How did you write it	0
Can you put the mic when you read it	0
Meaning all we have to do is lose one of the angles	0
Were going to do some teaching here	0
So thats your slope	0
Alexander this is yours from earlier answering my X coordinates	0
Explaining to us that numbers like 10 100 and 1000 are called powers of 10	0
We know that its half	0
Okay	0
I can go okay	0
Youre going to do number one	0
Can I reserve the fifth for tomorrow	0
And its tough to see I understand that	0
Okay if I can get everybody s attention please	0
Thank you	0
Because 3x1 is 3 and 4x2 is 8	0
And in the last one you have the sum of the square roots	0
Can you make me up a story to divide bodyboards in the ratio	0
So I have a S example here of what they did	0
So that one turned out kind of fuzzy	0
Negative 15	0
Yeah	0
Those are labeled this side is congruent to this side	0
Okay	0
We have Hudson	0
The product Oh here	0
And and I think that is important to	0
Okay	0
A is equal to second root of six square	0
sit on the chair	0
Okay so lesson 510 day one	0
close to zero or a little more than zero	0
Good job you guys	0
What happened when 19 and 20 Had a race	0
Thats why youre in trouble if you are fooled by the number here	0
It is a prism	0
There is one other thing I d like to do if we had time	0
Then we have the next box over here which is going to be one fourth	0
No	0
Yes	0
Kayla Im going to have you start	0
Just number one	0
You would say its y  or  1 or y is  or  1	0
I wasn t clear	0
We dont know if thatSis named Sally Timmy Tommy Bobby Billy	0
And I want to show you two rhombuses that do not work	0
Yeah	0
Mmhmm	0
Okay	0
Ill even show you	0
So now I step three says to subtract	0
So use your ratio table	0
2 times 8 is 16	0
Im just going to erase for you	0
And the first two questions on page four	0
You can open to nine point four page 588	0
Ha well of course	0
All done	0
You could do the area up here up here and here and add them up	0
I havent asked you to write anything on your boards	0
Figure three had 12 squares	0
Look at the number sentence	0
Stop side talking for your benefit	0
Good now start with your zero in your ones place	0
So lets do one more together	0
So when we explain what your answer means what exactly are we just supposed to explain	0
Sometimes arrows are the best way to do it	0
All right	0
So with that we automatically know now you did exactly the estimation that I wanted you to do	0
Oh there you go	0
Last time you actually showed me why you multiplied	0
Lets highlight to show where those angles come from	0
That s okay	0
SO we should have Oh I forgot to grab myself a colored pencil	0
Do you want us to come back	0
Thats the the letters that we used	0
No	0
Rodney can you go pick up the crafted paper	0
Adrian Now heres the suggestion from Michelle and the confirmation from Fabian you should only mark it four times	0
Well I counted eight times three to give me 24 and that was too much avocados and I realized that it just count four and a half to get 20 avocados and that was 10	0
Which one am I doing	0
Yeah	0
I multi Oh sorry	0
Four eight zero 10	0
divide	0
Yes	0
Its okay	0
You could keep going with the ratio table that you already have if you want to	0
Writet down	0
How is it twentytwo	0
I think its 21 because theres three on every corner of the seven houses	0
We cant take away one	0
What we would do is we would divide 23 by 23 and get one	0
And then I do the same thing with all the other points	0
All right okay	0
Well lets see on the next on the next goaround	0
Miss  You put six tenths	0
Sure	0
Ill be back so that I can check on you	0
Noah Erics not going to be here today so do you want sit here so that you can be  partner	0
Yes	0
And they could be zero comma four because then that helps you to understand its the y intercept or not the x intercept	0
Just go ahead and graph as many points as you can	0
Yeah	0
So you guys got to compare prices today	0
I would like you to do the next one now both of you	0
Uh no here youve got three times that X and uh	0
Complete journal page 146	0
We have a good surface level	0
Lets see why its 14	0
All right	0
Thats what I wanted to see	0
And then four hundredths	0
I I am just going to pull it aside	0
So you have been working on a fraction of a whole but now I think youre going to work on whole of a fraction	0
And thats our math fluency	0
Have you written these down on your board you still have the same things on your board that we had back at the beginning	0
Totally different but its symmetrical and so the mean and the median are the same	0
Very good	0
I forgot again	0
First of all I need to ask Mason what is your daily affirmation today Mason	0
Because I picked the skin on it	0
You need to focus more friend	0
If you eat five eggs in one week and Hunter there are 100 weeks in two years	0

I m just not sure	0
No not yet	0
Hold them up	0
We are going to do a quick review of our I hope youre ready	0
Good Steve	0
All right here was what unit one was about it was about solving equations	0
I will know I am successful when I can explain how the alignment of the decimals help me solve problems one through three or journal page 146	0
Had lots of different discussion about how the scale should be set up	0
I understand how you represented the two numbers but the hard thing with that you didnt represent the taking away or the subtracting	0
Remember who your partners were friends	0
Awesome	0
Hang on a second	0
I think	0
We found the average of the seventh and eighth piece	0
The rate	0
So  study these land plots on journal page 208	0
So turn it over and most of chapter eight that were gonna deal with is dealing with exponents	0
Nice job	0
Im going to pass these out	0
And remember thats the same as reflecting it once and then reflecting it again	0
Excellent	0
Then I found half my number to get to 23 so this would be 43	0
Okay	0
Let me do 126	0
So lets go to our fourth person	0
Five zeros following four zeros	0
23 x 11  1	0
And you should have lots of squares	0
Come on	0
Awesome	0
You have to try to solve them now using this method	0
Okay	0
She said we she didnt give a specific person in her number story but I think thats okay	0
Thats why	0
Okay thank you Landon	0
Choose all those that correctly describe the situation	0
Three divided by two is one point five five minus one point five is three point five	0
Yeah	0
All right	0
Oh those are not opposites	0
Talk to your neighbor about what it is and how you know	0
Thank you for being a respectful listener	0
Theres the same number of zeros on both of them	0
Specify there in which one youd like to work with the problem	0
Number two still missing	0
Yes	0
All right your table is correct	0
So I think we would like to see a little with numbers in the vicinity of 15	0
Okay	0
I can follow her thinking	0
Told you	0
She makes his one and a half gallons of apple juice with one and a half gallons of grape juice	0
Ill let you think about it for a second	0
Do you think this is correct	0
So get out your math journal please	0
This and this and this	0
Four minus five equals one squared	0
All right	0
So all I did is exactly what you guys did last week when you were adding mixed numbers and I gave everything a common denominator	0
Three times negative nine	0
So that I can check them	0
I appreciate that there were several of you who put yourselves out there with new things when you werent sure how to do them which is awesome	0
Eight pizzas for three people	0
And we should get y equals 43	0
Were going to test next Wednesday	0
Showdown	0
er 1 1 We are going to do two and four independently	0
Find the treasure	0
Miss Polly please tell our class why multiplying eight times three gives us our common denominator	0
Of course you can test for the others	0
I dont think so	0
How come	0
The hardest part about these problems is explaining how you know your answer is reasonable with when you justify	0
Im rounding to the nearest 10	0
All right	0
Huh	0
So now I have to label them onefour	0
Yeah	0
Good	0
Now weve done our tickKingslys now we need to shade the rectangle with the given dimensions	0
Did you make your Go to login to Google Classroom	0

Everybodys picture will look the same	0
Im going to Did I get off here	0
Want to work together	0
Thats all right	0
That was	0
Thirty five	0
Or we add all the sides	0
Okay	0
Number one and number two youre not doing much other than labeling and use either labeling with letters or labeling with the marks	0
Five now looks perfect	0
When we would divide things up into groups	0
Thats wonderful	0
So let me see something very quickly to make sure Im explaining this right	0
And so because I know what Im looking for I can follow the	0
Um yeah	0
You reflect on your thinking and keep trying when the problem is hard	0
Remember when you have a rational expression equal to zero all you have to do is set the numerator equal to zero to solve it	0
And were going to start by looking at this math question	0
Everybody got their	0
Guys we need to focus	0
Okay all right	0
He does jump through the wall too right	0
We are not doing that sir	0
Im going to	0
So she substituted in the eighth to come up with three eighths	0
I would like to keep it that way but my microphone because I took it home last night is not working	0
That is the new one	0
Wider	0
Youre fine	0
An X in the tens	0
I want you to look at your line plot right here	0
Youre close	0
Are all 6s like that	0
And then I have this piece left over here	0
Nope good guess though	0
Okay	0
Your warmup for today oh my gosh were going to go back just a little bit to when you were in elementary school	0
Okay	0
All right	0
OK so you ve written out three rows and then you wrote out the nth row	0
I didnt know the answer but I did solve	0
Okay lets go	0
I think you know but I think youre having a hard time explaining it	0
If you want some help Im going to help you with the sentence starter	0
Lets see how quick we can do before recess	0
You guys I did them in 7th period too	0
So let me get you replaced four a new change	0
I see Ember and Gunnar really good kneetoknee	0
Watch me	0
412 and a 13	0
Sorry friends	0
Good	0
I make a big circle and then come up like a ponytail	0
There s one sixth another sixth another sixth another sixth another  sixth another sixth and if you split them in half there s three of  them on top	0
Three fourths colored in on all of these and there is 10 squares and there is three colored in and so three times 10 equals	0
Good	0
Okay	0
Tell me from here what I can do	0
Okay	0
Well why dont you do it then	0
In this case so negative 5x plus 50	0
Okay show me	0
Thats another way of doing just three	0
One share is 50	0
Excellent job	0
So when it says ordered pair we actually want like the coordinates of a point	0
So because this graph this line only crosses once ever once at a time this is a function	0
Now dont do anything with your calculators until we all get started please	0
You are welcome	0
It would end up at 25	0
Lets start off with Cassidys	0
And then four minus two is twothirds two minus one equals one	0
If you got to this point if you said Ah I know I need to divide perfect	0
Yes sir	0
Flip flop that for me	0
Threefourths	0
Six and two	0
Person number three I want you to put the yellows away	0
It depends on what speed theyre going with	0
Circle the whole thing	0
Okay	0
So if you pulled the fraction sheet out I will come and get it	0
Okay	0
And give everybody another 30 seconds or so	0
Umm	0
The tens	0
Theyre not because for  every one liter of orange juice Lynns has one and onethird soda water and for Zyon for every one liter of orange juice we have one and onefourth liters of soda water	0
No no	0
Yep	0
Okay	0
Is this on closer two zero or one	0
I did not know what you mean but from the answer do you mean the one where you do something times four equals 112	0
You re going to have to come  up with what you mean by that	0
But I want to be able to answer your questions as well if you have any	0
I didnt give you one	0
We want to try to  have maybe an operation or a company that produces lots of  these bows with very little waste	0
You worked out there for a while and then came back to the car	0
Mhm yes well the	0
Oh yes youre next sorry	0
Its 57 degrees	0
There you go	0
And then the	0
And the rest are like watered down is totally fine	0
Not on all of them	0
So were going here and were going	0
Good	0
Now what I would like you to do Oh 179	0
Alright lets see where were at	0
How could this be	0
All right	0
Indeed	0
Okay so theres a little boat part of it theres the sale part of it	0
Okay my two friends that I called on Austin go up there first and explain your groups thinking and work	0
Okay	0
this side is congruent to this side	0
Obviously unmute	0
Then put the  All right	0
SS I know that 48 is equivalent to 12 which is 5	0
Thats what goes into the little box	0
And that was my bad because I said it wrong the first time	0
Okay there you go	0
Uh by the end of this week the chapter has to be completely finished	0
And Im just going to walk through what would happen here	0
Now so the example then would be next	0
And the next ones 100	0
No youre not working	0
All right	0
All right	0
Okay	0
Its Okay if theyre not perfect because were going to draw on that symbol that means congruent	0
That dont have the same denominator	0
So thats just a trick to help you remember it	0
Ok so thats like the question we were  asking here	0
I have no ideas what Meredith is going to  do	0
Two thirds	0
So were multiplying	0
Awesome	0
Okay	0
I know I just did one	0
It seems like everyone other than Arai is okay	0
But like negative slope even if its really steep you can ski down it you could hike down it or whatever positive slope even if its really steep steep you could hike or bike or ski or whatever but undefined doesnt work	0
Its really important	0
Yes	0
Y equals 110	0
One more with your partner	0
Okay the rise is one the run is two choose a different color there	0
There you go	0
And now we have this paper and we have this paper so we have two of our papers	0
You want us to move our desks	0
Uh and it doesnt print out in color either	0
So no sandals	0
Did you write down the question	0
Its best if you write the question since its an example so write divide 200 dollars	0
We took this one piece and we turned it into two pieces	0
Yes	0
Huh	0
So we have eight and 10 we need to find a common denominator	0
put your name on this	0
Thank you ladies	0
Okay	0
Heres a nice picture of a scarecrow	0
Alright so it looks like everybody has some great points here	0
Is there a faster way to  you always	0
All right	0
So go ahead and divide each pizza into fifths	0
That pencil is all over the place down here okay	0
Look at all those numbers to add up	0
Do you want us to use tick marks	0
Three times two is six	0
Heres our next question	0
Rods	0
Im thinking of a number 12	0
That would equal 20 because three  plus three equals six and seven plus seven equals 14	0
They are in fact exactly the same	0
that wants you to draw a picture	0
Okay so now lets look at	0
Okay lets see here	0
I want to go to this party	0
Diana One two	0
So thatll be another way to show	0
Multiplication	0
I think you guys did very well Im very proud of you	0
Okay	0
Okay you have two assignments that you have to show me	0
We have little bit more work that we need to do on your note catcher	0
Yeah I think its the correct line	0
So we needed to understand that I needed to know what he ate first half of three fourths	0
Hes very slow because hes a turtle	0
Right	0
Hudson you dont just sit there and not do anything without asking for help	0
Okay Nameless Richard there you go buddy	0
All right Ive done a lot of talking today	0
Thats what we did in general every time	0
Friends I think I ve seen some common confusion	0
Okay	0
So I want to show you a couple things	0
It will soon enough	0
Its making funny noises	0
Ill give you one more minute	0
Yeah	0
Wow	0
Then he wrote number four slash two eight slash three	0
Maybe the first word that comes to my mind when I think modeling First word I think is  Americas Next Top Model  but when Im relating it to math I think like maybe like a picture of something	0
So Im just going to kind of do my best to eyeball it	0
I know that its no because youre minusing 50 so that means its lower like a lower answer	0
Okay everybody please put your books away	0
Thats a good question	0
Heres my question	0
So if each box is three centimeters and you have 16 boxes youre really just doing 16 times three to find x which is when you get when you cross multiply here 16 times three equals 1x	0
Draw it like that	0
There it goes	0
All right we got about two seconds till 228	0
What to prepare for level twos	0
A few of you agree with this argument	0
Thats quite a long distance isnt it	0
Did you get your book Annalise by the way	0
Youre going to push it like these are the clock hands it doesnt matter if one is the hour and one is the minute	0
Okay	0
Were going to do a little review	0
Class I need to hear more than four people	0
Let me give you your Eagle bucks Just a second	0
Like what we just did on the town map	0
So lets just look at part C right now	0
Okay yeah thats true	0
Stand up	0
Im not sure why were flinging dry erase markers anyway	0
Excellent	0
Okay	0
Well look at this all together please	0
You can	0
Two 28 and 58	0
I am sure he will arrive shortly	0
And also 50 plus 30 is 80	0
I said product excuse me I meant quotient	0
Now after weve found our common denominator you have to do whatever you do to the bottom	0
I ll get you an overhead	0
He draws a picture of the book on a coordinate grid	0
An answer	0
Only do the top	0
The next one that you have is your mode	0
So you say okay negative one matches up with one because in the table negative one matches up with one and this point negative one matches up with one	0
how just get an answer but why dont we just get an answer but thats not the answer its looking for	0
Okay thank you	0
Hey table four	0
Very quick	0
the other equation is you could use this simplified fraction so y equals negative three halfs x	0
I should actually do them from least to greatest instead	0
Okay	0
And if we made a mistake being able to evaluate where we made the mistake	0
Yes	0
And cooking is more like dinner	0
Ive acknowledged that	0
Whoa	0
Rectangle	0
I mean give one candy to Cindy	0
Wow only two people three people	0
So what Id like you to do is label this line right here with an arrow	0
It also intercepts arc B D	0
Lets look at our learning intention for today	0
Im afraid we need  a little bit more work on that model	0
Its the beauty of math	0
Yes	0
So calendar I mentioned to you earlier um so yesterday math Excel assignment number three	0
Therefore it is eight again	0
Hey guys	0
So	0
And this is where you need to listen to directions very carefully	0
Well you have this a hundred thats like this extra term but then this right here is like your MX	0
Okay so if you are like trying to figure out what the domain of this table is then okay well the domain is all the x values	0
Thats the most important principal of this assignment	0
Now if you havent gotten started yet this is a part to part to part to whole ratio	0
Youre telling me youre ready right now by having your whiteboard away	0
Three times two	0
and take a seat in five four three two one and zero	0
Okay	0
Oh I thought you meant one	0
Do you remember	0
The other side same thing  goes on the middle	0
I love it	0
Then you know how long it is how wide it is how high it is	0
Go	0
Anyway lets get started	0
I didnt write it out and then this would be number 4	0
Just erase the information which we dont need anymore so we can see the problems clearly	0
The division makes it smaller	0
I can apply and extend my understanding of finding fractions of whole numbers	0
And seven and 31 hundredths	0
Lets go back to the problem	0
I did	0
Those mean the same thing	0
I went from the pizzeria all the way over until the park entrance which is right above	0
Lovely	0
Excellent job	0
Whatever we decide to do down here to get where we want to go we would also do it here	0
Jacob you are done	0
Give people some think time and that means youre being respectful	0
And the answer to that is yes and no	0
So I want you to point to your partner right now who you usually work with	0
Sum of interior angles of a polygon	0
Six less than a number	0
When youve got both of them done put your finger on your nose so that I know youve got them	0
So if you were outside talking in line during the field drill I need you to think about your behavior	0
Yes	0
So an 89 theres an eight and theres a nine	0
and I do partial products	0
pictures	0
Nine	0
Lets move forward together as a team to do this right	0
Your book is gone then	0
But were doing three quarters and  two thirds	0
Yes	0
All these places right there its right here	0
Youre on  boxes	0
Yes	0
Okay we did that	0
This sheet that you have is just outlining the steps that weve already done	0
smaller	0
Okay Beth  has one for us	0
Here is what Id like you to do	0
If I cut a pizza into eighths and I take one piece away I have seven eighths of the pizza left	0
Okay so just be aware of that	0
You will have to use a different model	0
Reasonable answers on those	0
Yes right	0
You guys think of this as a line	0
Just like 50 cents just like half of a dollar	0
Okay	0
We have to bring them in	0
Were running late we should be starting writing right now but were not	0
Go ahead and finish up that page for your math message	0
Because he lost it	0
And weve also known because were so good at our factors and multiples that the only numbers that have an odd number of factors are square numbers	0
and I am still missing two	0
Lets start with the largest	0
And the highest it ever goes is zero	0
Well itll do	0
176 give me a zero	0
Michael	0
We have 11 we should have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 we should have 17	0
You get 130	0
All right	0
I dont understand	0
You would	0
So one fourth equals three twelfths	0
12 divided by zero	0
Sh	0
Theres a graph that I want you to fill out with the points in the table	0
Well at least you got a tux	0
No	0
Zero negative integer and negative fraction	0
So for every one liter of orange juice we have one and onethird liters of soda water	0
the squished square	0
You have 146 in your piggy bank	0
Explain to your partner  Let me see yours	0
Thanks for sharing your votes with me	0
Excellent	0
Someone is asking a question	0
Place it on your desk	0
Turn knee to knee	0
They gave us a problem	0
Very good youre good now pick your two	0
Thank you	0
Im going to actually pick a couple of partner pairs	0
Wait hold on	0
All right	0
Okay here we go	0
If I have to hit those three dots and hug up against those two asymptotes the only way to do that is to make a graph that goes like this in this region	0
Unit three is the basics of lines and functions	0
Nathan you were supposed to use the rule	0
I said make sure you are there	0
Eric and Alyssa join up	0
Were getting rid of the dots	0
Someone said this	0
Two different expressions	0
Six and twothirds	0
There is a large large large amount of luck	0
Talk to a partner about I want you to do a thinking in your head	0
Some of you are done and I totally get that but were still going to look at it	0
You simply had to fill in the numbers there	0
All right friends	0
All right	0
One fourth	0
This may seem like a really dumb question but I hope it isnt pointless but um suppose the home team won the fiTeachert two games the away team won the third game and the home team won the fourth game	0
Stop	0
There s no question	0
You may put your answer on your board and then hide it	0
Yeah we absolutely could do four	0
Im wondering if I can have one volunteer who has not come to the board yet today to solve the problem using multiples and skip counting and a different person to solve with the quick common denominator strategy	0
Did I give out round 2 of the 10 ego box	0
This one is I really like well because I really love coordinate grids	0
If we were to reference pizzas this would be the whole thing	0
Okay then one two one two three four okay	0
Yes and now now you have to think about it what does it mean that is zero	0
Thank you	0
Please stand	0
But some of you seem to think it could go somewhere else and I m very confused	0
Get your face out of the phones	0
Okay	0
So therefore its gonna be so Team A is gonna  they have a better shot at winning it for  than the other one	0
This is going to go in your math binder because youre keeping this	0
So you could go down by a half every time but thats going to be kind of a crowded and messy graph	0
Mariah  here friends	0
You would totally get that	0
Multiplicative identity property	0
So like I said we found the smallest fraction	0
So I dont think it will be that far off	0
Minus 12 3	0
Now youre in the wrong unit	0
Were not solving it	0
So remember you use your slope to multiply by x	0
Thank you	0
What	0
Theyre going to be different so justify your answer	0
Good work	0
Why did you do 177	0
One two three four five six nine 18	0
And then I did 3 times 9 which was	0
I was going too fast	0
Ive only done right here	0
You will have time to talk today	0
I didnt	0
You have 1010s of something or 100100s of something	0
Then 60 times 120 equals 7200	0
The amount	0
Zach who would you like to work with today	0
Well talk about that in a second	0
Now you could have done them either direction it would have been okay	0
Now Im hoping once we can make it come up is a question about Jake	0
Is that all	0
So we are going to continue our study of ratios today	0
Thank you Ellis	0
In your rule you said you will do half of that one twenty	0
Whoo	0
draw one more card to create a divisor	0
Perfect	0
Plus two	0
Well I think we ve run out of time	0
Because youre adding on the whole	0
Now answer the question	0
Well try to be efficient with this	0
Okay	0
Two	0
Now someone else from my group	0
Red	0
All right	0
Watabes is less than 2000 yen	0
Ive got friends back here being rude	0
Yeah	0
Each time that number comes up you put a stroke into your cookie	0
So um lets look at this um strategies	0
Hers are not	0
its called the bow tie method	0
I think that was the first time all I think that was the first time all all semester that I beat you to it	0
All right so what we re going to do right now is around	0
No	0
Okay so I will have everyone draw the vertical line here at the important point in just a second	0
Well then please look at the problem	0
Okay	0
So what you need to do is you need to go to exam login and theres your code	0
But youre short 200 yen	0
Okay	0
Over here	0
Good	0
For I were going to go over four down three	0
So in this case there is no negative negative sign	0
What is the approximate surface area of the earth round to the nearest million square miles	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
shows the thing squared there	0
I just  close their eyes	0
Here the mob gathers to observe the deadly  and by the way meerkats are fiercely territorial and will fight to defend their turf from snakes or other meerkat mobs	0
I heard what Andrew said was	0
I think this does work	0
And the other way we observed yesterday well we said to each other that we could also check which ones are not linear	0
This one by yourself	0
Yes my dear	0
I did choir last year	0
We talked about how the denominator can be part of the whole shape and then the numerator is how many parts are shaded in or taken out	0
Right	0
Youre really getting to know  these	0
34 left over	0
Oh come on people	0
So yeah	0
I cant have a mixed number and an improper fraction	0
Stop	0
You have to do a couple of proofs so two proofs	0
I dont know how	0
Russell thats a perfect place for you	0
You can sit down if you want to	0
excellent	0
Its passed back	0
Now Teresa can go up and try it	0
A couple of things of when you write numbers you have a hyphen here	0
Im going to color in the one I ate darkest	0
Wait	0
Exactly	0
Its number five	0
Got you okay	0
So Ill write O equals two times Pi times R	0
Theres a couple of problems	0
Four times four equals 16	0
Id like everybody to watch what they do  because if you have a different way of thinking about it Id like  to see that also	0
Point seventy 2	0
Are you guys talking in the back	0
The area is	0
Yeah	0
I can	0
So we had Okay so I think I know right here	0
I want to hear their responses	0
I dont have a question	0
Over here we have three and over here we have three as well so that is six minus five equals one F	0
You guys I want you think about this question	0
Thats what an estimate is	0
Youre doing multiples	0
You have a two and you have a one	0
I need to be giving you guys lots of points	0
Lets pull a stick	0
Part of it mightve been because we tried to add all four together but lets check okay	0
Yes well first you are going to lets have a quick look	0
Okay	0
Its 2000 but I want to know why its 2000 and not 200 when I only have two zeros	0
Mr Haley where there you are thank you	0
Okay so Im going to turn this off	0
Okay pizza	0
Like this or like	0
All right so are you guys ready	0
Were going to practice adding those mixed numbers	0
And then we multiplied by three	0
Uh huh	0
One	0
Split it in half Clay	0
Great	0
I know I can make it 12	0
But you know I see N plus one parenthesis minus parenthesis X plus one	0
Oh its fine	0
Okay and so its super convenient to be able to write this out as you go up three over two and thats your slope	0
Were going to revisit our multiplication	0
Yes	0
Look at page seven if you need to look at your ingredients	0
So itd be one fourth	0
Okay now Im not ready to start doing the algebra kicking things out yet	0
And so the exes are negative 204 and five	0
But you should get in there and you actually do it for junior breakout rooms	0
Can I doublecheck your problem	0
Write 10 to the power of six	0
So I did the twenty one plus the inaudible And when I did that I got to 200 I mean 231000ths and then I added that by the 6 plus 6 the those ones and that and then when I added them all together I got 3007 3000 2376 thousandths	0
This 30 represents the amount of ice	0
I hope you guys have your activities ready from the boxes from nine point four	0
Just pull your chair away from where you are going to be nervous	0
As long as Haven does not mess up adding she will be victorious	0
So we talked about long division we talked about a diagram and heres our ratio table	0
So imagine if the if this makes sense	0
So this question looks similar to the other ones that we we did like before Thanksgiving	0
Lets listen to  what Meredith says	0
Do it from where things are posted below	0
So were going to jump on to slide number three	0
Okay	0
All right lets go to page 61	0
I think we have like one more	0
So if I follow this down boom theres a two what y goes with it	0
4 tenths plus 4 tenths plus 4 tenths plus 4 tenths is 1six	0
Now lets take the example so Barbara and Andrea were able to find it	0
Okay	0
Yep	0
Um wait this would be one whole this is one half and one of these  would be one fourth	0
Albany lets start that	0
Thats correct	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Hundredths	0
When theres a lot of walking around when Im talking its really disruptive to me	0
And then our last step is the foot	0
Im going to have you all Oh my gosh I love how many volunteers I have already	0
Okay	0
Me	0
I just clicked assignment and then Im clicking my document again and now its opening	0
Thats what Im saying	0
All right so friends	0
That would totally work	0
Tick marks not boxes	0
Do you need me to fill this up with water	0
Thats your job	0
Thank you	0
Yes thats correct	0
Okay slope equals zero	0
Thank you for being willing to come up and explain that Judy because putting our thinking into words is sometimes the hardest thing to do	0
Oh ah that s really clever	0
Oh All right Im seeing a lot of right answers	0
This is important information	0
Hey thank your partners and return to your seats please	0
Awesome	0
Piper I want to talk to you more about your question because Im not sure if I understand	0
Yeah	0
Oh no no no	0
When its outside the circle	0
Team four	0
Okay	0
Were going to pick up were going to pick this up again on Monday but if you happen to ask these questions	0
So the first thing I did was see if I could multiply anything by three to get to twelve	0
So were going to start with three and 23 plus five and 56	0
I think its a little bit before for	0
But theres a kicker theres a trick	0
please	0
One equals 21	0
Whatever	0
And I need one more stick here	0
So put the zero there	0
4 x 6 is 24	0
This is where drawing that model would be helpful	0
I think they are due Monday	0
No I dont	0
First the Raiders	0
All right now I have to subtract that 82 from the 75	0
All right lets keep going	0
Awesome	0
Youre putting in a tree	0
Then do it	0
Yeah	0
But youre really not paying for anything right now so why should you pay that much now without without any movies right now	0
Would it be the same for sine x	0
You do share things like pizzas and muffins and cookies and granola bars	0
Im going to have you help start me on this one	0
Okay	0
Okay and then the recommended order	0
Yes	0
So I would call that wider	0
So their distance is three miles	0
Okay	0
please	0
And I appreciate it when you share	0
I know most of you will probably take this home and go Mom and Dad help	0
So all the way down there	0
Okay	0
Great	0
Okay Ethan	0
Were going to read this together	0
Sorry	0
By breaking apart one time with a picture	0
And now all we have left is our one times our ones	0
I dont see any zero here	0
We are saying	0
I dont know how long it lasts	0
Rebecca grab four triangles	0
All right can I get my Ms Gibson assistance to please collect the homework	0
Those are examples of situations that might be realworld	0
Its not just the two friends were talking about Mary	0
Okay	0
You guys did not	0
Okay	0
Huh	0
Okay	0
In order to make sure that this one looks the same I have to do one more cut	0
Were going to start off with some mental math to get our brains thinking	0
29 should go right there	0
Yes	0
This is How much do 20 avocados cost	0
So 12345 Okay next line	0
Hardly used	0
The white ones as well as the blue ones	0
Okay	0
taking long since were starting	0
Because if youre putting the power up in front of the number that youre multiplying that is not the power of	0
Okay I have six 7 of 20 responses	0
Write an addition number sentence for the representation on this grid	0
All right Wade listen to one more person	0
Im already at four which means your hands should be up all your materials	0
Very good	0
Check it out	0
What am I supposed to do	0
This is today	0
Stand up	0
But it s not tight	0
So show me you can be patient	0
Lets look at number four	0
Would you roll it properly please	0
One second	0
It is going to be 8 and 48	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Lets try one other number	0
I think maybe it would be ok try sharing a little bit of the secret without telling everybody everything	0
So so its basically the rule for number three but just kind of put in whole number for them	0
Get a little festive	0
Five four three two one	0
Okay	0
If you can understand why that doesnt work or what I did wrong and explain what I did wrong	0
Your run is three and hopefully you can see this as well two to five if you have five minus two you get three oh the power just shut off over here	0
Eight times six equals 48	0
So the two comes second in the first one	0
undefined is a vertical line	0
Yes I think the teams are due tomorrow and its 5 per person	0
Did you do your homework Mary	0
I wanna see if you fall into the trap	0
So lets turn this into to have 24 as our denominator	0
We  have lot of good ideas that we need to think about	0
A times A and you do that three times	0
Adam whats annoying	0
That is very very nice	0
And even if you dont know take a guess	0
Ichiro is one second in short in short the difference in the amounts of money on that one day	0
Let me do this side to multiply the top and the bottom by three	0
Raise your hand	0
You probably havent heard of it because it hasnt come out yet	0
All right two and half minutes	0
Okay	0
There are a few over there	0
You guys are telling me that Im wrong but 56 plus zero is 56	0
But first	0
Okay	0
Do you know that every time JD needs a new pencil he pays me a token for one	0
Just a moment	0
Hm okay	0
He had his hand up	0
In the ratio and they went to market	0
So thats why I said be reasonable so now youre using your equivalent fractions to write equivalent fractions for 45	0
Right Im seeing a little bit more struggles on this one which I expect because now we have the variable on both sides of the equation which always makes it a little bit harder to deal with	0
When it says Did they pay the same rate	0
One fourth	0
If you know your facts this is going to be so much easier	0
You might have to look back try it from memory or look in your notes	0
Success criteria I will know I have it when I can explain how my drawing or paper folded model is a representation of the fraction products	0
No	0
Or its points but yes points left is the Y	0
Because you are going to be studying number lines for a long time for a number of years	0
Greater than less than or equal to	0
All right	0
Okay	0
three cans of food	0
If theyre in different places like this one its over one on each so your decimal would only be over one	0
Good	0
You all agree	0
Blue on blue is a terrible choice hang on	0
One twoeyes on you	0
I thought you might definitely want that	0
Okay	0
Whos got the pencil that small	0
So before we can compare anything we should think about being able to categorize it a little bit	0
All the side links got twice as big but we can fit four of the shapes in it	0
Lets take a little detour	0
Quite a lot of you havent yet got to that stage of writing all of those things onto your page	0
There I thought I was going to trick you and I didnt	0
If you look at here guys	0
Im going to color it in she got this whole piece and she got half of this one	0
Whole number	0
Blue has done it	0
When you get an answer for this I want you to put into the chat	0
I just dont want to see a division problem	0
So weve got 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44	0
range is the y values	0
How do you get zero equals one	0
I have no idea	0
I want everybody to talk about this real quick	0
how did you get those different fonts Then	0
Go	0
With your map	0
They used great vocabulary	0
With the sheets	0
To find fractions of fractions	0
Perfect	0
Now number four is left	0
This time were saying that a triangle is onethird	0
Well check it later	0
You would	0
Okay so you are going to put that code in go to exam login	0
If its not consistent its not going to be a straight line so its nonlinear	0
I can t hear I can t hear what Michael is saying	0
Okay write down the answers to these please	0
Yes I did	0
Ill be right back there	0
Good	0
Awesome	0
So nice job you guys	0
So to figure  so to go back to this stuff what Ethan did was he switched it	0
We are only worried if in the integer I dont know what that is	0
All right	0
This is Breeze bunny if you know  No thats her sisters name if you know  locks	0
This is an improper fraction the numerators larger than the denominator	0
All right	0
No but they already have one in grid one	0
Okay	0
Thanks guys	0
Thats right	0
Okay so I want you to notice that functions in my mind are kind of a little bit weird to think about it	0
I am going to let you work with a partner today to go through these problems	0
No	0
Thirty	0
Yes 36	0
Okay let me see	0
Very good Haley	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Were going to start with 10 to the power of were going to write the exponential notation and then we are going to write it in standard form	0
Thank you	0
Okay	0
Shoulder partner	0
So I know its going to go on this side	0
Here	0
We are going to set up a quick whiteboard if I  and Im going to put this link in the chat	0
Yes so	0
Lets do two	0
Lets talk about cube roots	0
Okay	0
Or we can practice one of the theorems of equivalence	0
So its not somebody asked me like does the final count	0
Please have your homework and your calendar on your desk	0
6 times 22 is the actual answer	0
Okay	0
I want to hear less talking from table two	0
So 16 we can write this as 16 with the 6 repeating	0
Oh sorry	0
He ate 512 of a sandwich	0
The rest of us are going to turn our dryerase boards over for now and then well compare after theyre finished	0
All right	0
I only counted up 58 times thats how I got my answer	0
Ill stop by and take a look at those too	0
If that was on the final do we have to write it under the	0
Okay then well do it on four	0
So lets be really careful about the two parts	0
Okay so good job catching up I know you were out	0
I need one of those back	0
She said she was going to multiply three times twelve	0
Were going to play a game	0
I do have apples come here	0
Nine our denominator nine	0
For example if I had bag of MMs and they were 50 MMs and I ate 10 of my MMs which would not be true because I would definitely eat more like 80 of a bag of MMs but I only want to figure out 10	0
So if theres a circle for example number three number five number seven there should be something Pi in your answer	0
Stay here when class is over	0
We got 25 for both of those	0
Okay	0
Go	0
Im so sorry	0
Shut up	0
Thats our starting shape	0
I dont know if I should be changing that	0
Go onto number three	0
So we are done	0
Then you have to cross out all of the numbers on the 9 and the 4 and the 8	0
And this is going to become exceedingly important as we continue to journey through the wonderful world of geometry	0
So three times four is 12 plus one is 13	0
Okay	0
That is our rule	0
How much oil should you use to make a total of 28 teaspoons of dressing	0
Yeah	0
Yeah	0
So the problem goes like this Robbie says thank you you guys helped him distinguish between area and perimeter and he says that in this square which is 3 inches and 3 inches of length and 3 inches of the height he says the area of the square is 9 square inches	0
The definition of infinity is that it keeps going it never stops	0
Its twice as wide but the height actually is still the same	0
Were on page 63	0
So lets change that	0
Okay the only problem is youve got to do this which is perfect	0
Its fine	0
So give him this pencil back	0
I figured out I actually did do it wrong but just a little bit	0
Okay	0
We just looked at each others to tell	0
Turn them on	0
So red equals one ml red paint and the blue equals one ml a blue paint	0
Thank you Summer for being able to share	0
Its twosided but what I mean by one side of it is you will only copy one of us down	0
There is one more Im looking for	0
Okay so Im going to read to you the answer that they gave in the book	0
Compare your prediction in problem two to the new picture	0
So if I look at 9 and 12 Im going to create a division model to find the LCM	0
Okay	0
So this point matches up with x equals one both of these points match up with four	0
It doesnt matter the order you do them in whatever	0
Okay so were gonna get 6x equals 5x plus one	0
Two and then I divided it into thirds because I needed to do groups of twothirds	0
Wheres my	0
Nine	0
Shawn Valerie is out today	0
Okay um lets make it a little bit smaller This time lets do 89 times lets do 8 no we just did eight	0
Yes thats the one though	0
Look to see what your box number is the measurements the dimensions of that box	0
Yeah	0
All right	0
We need to know how many dollars are in a euro how many euros in a dollar	0
Give yourself a check or an X	0
Nice one Jane	0
I know thats good	0
Yeah	0
You dont get to sit and do nothing	0
Six times ten is sixty so twenty rods times ten is two hundred and through my rule you subtract it by two to get one ninety eight and then	0
I had friends draw a circle on the back and if you draw a half and you draw another half it makes fourths	0
Instead of a perfectly equal thing	0
Can I get two Ms Levys in training to pass	0
So this question actually has two possible answers	0
For number four I turned three thirds into a whole inaudible and the 13rd into a whole	0
No I just picked the fraction 25 to see what it would be equivalent to	0
Jimbo hurry up	0
So if we go back to our problem the principle is ordering snack size bags of pretzels	0
What table do you have	0
Youre going to do all of that	0
Hold on	0
Theres some good questions	0
Really I dont have math master page 51	0
Happy to stop and explain Whatever you need okay	0
Thats thats what you have to make sure	0
Okay so weve got this first part done	0
All right people that was a lot of time on this stuff thank you for bearing with me on that	0
So I dont mean to put Im not putting you on the spot	0
So if you bisect this angle you split it in half and each one would be 45 degrees	0
Umm	0
They just come up with they just have all famous sayings	0
This is my X so Im going up by 10 every time	0
Mmmmm	0
Well so lets look at the theorem that it wants us to fill in	0
Talk to your friends	0
The only way you can solve something like this	0
Steve homework	0
Okay	0
I know but Alicia already came up to the board	0
Get ready	0
So Charlie gave us a little bit of information and she definitely highlighted this pieces that there are five books in a package	0
Oh wait	0
Almost	0
Ive seen the soaring	0
You can just multiply across	0
I forgot what	0
Or can you only see my screen	0
So zero and then 30	0
Well have to see	0
Brian had that one  too ok he was the only other person who had that one	0
Mr G 18  4 would be 22 right	0
So they have a common factor of three	0
Oh sorry	0
Just as long as you understand what that bow tie method is	0
Well this is a third this is two thirds one third	0
Think about what happens when you multiply by zeros	0
Let me see your journal	0
Every time you move over one for x you go up by 13 of the box	0
Okay	0
No just changed to something else	0
Make sense of the problem	0
Um at the end of this week the whole chapter has to be finished	0
What page again	0
Alright guys	0
Hold on Brandon	0
And I got 20 thousand	0
Ill draw my own picture while were working on this	0
So who who thinks they have pick up if you have fewer than 15 blocks	0
I  also would like particularly the table of Beth Jessica  Laura Kimberly and Alan to write up your why your rule  works	0
You must use one of each of the shapes	0
Lets see here	0
SS right you should have seven	0
Ms Levy fractions  multiplication	0
Thats not what I heard Erik he drew a picture yesterday and what I heard yesterday Alan  saying is that he wasstill talking about that same space	0
You	0
Yes	0
triangle adds up to 180	0
This means two times the quantity X  3  14	0
Please plot 81	0
I would like you to do five first	0
Modeling with fraction circles	0
When I see this I want to see something that looks more like this over here	0
Remember  when we did this last year Okay so you re going to decide  what your group answer is and how you did it and put it on  a large paper for me	0
You all saw different ways to do this	0
All you should have is one half on your board	0
Uhuh	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
So one must at least two sections	0
Bam bam	0
Sure	0
If you get to it theres also Part D that you could think about with your group	0
I think it might be right there in your bag	0
Threefourths cup of blueberries	0
Yes	0
Add 180 and then you would add 180 to each one of those	0
I know what mine is	0
I do you have to get mine settled	0
Lovely	0
Its Jasper for you	0
Now if you say to your partner No thats wrong	0
So these two points match up since the range is the y values that matches up with eight	0
Okay	0
Once its concave it doesnt stay yep	0
So all of the ingredients are mixed together	0
Brilliant	0
Okay	0
She understood what it was asking her	0
How to complicate it when one can do it simply thats Herves proposition	0
Now what I want you to do because I want you to take those fractions you might need those  behind you	0
Divide it in half please	0
seven thirds	0
Put it in that corner baby	0
So  the numbering was a very good strategy	0
13	0
Wow interesting	0
But anyway so were discussing with who are youre discussing with	0
Yes	0
Big time	0
Quixotic	0
We need students which is one of our parts	0
Emmitt clip up	0
Alright so I want to show everybody this answer	0
Okay	0
Okay Erase	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
Okay lets go ahead and look at the next one	0
Equal	0
Bam	0
And I hear a lot of you making connections back to sports and videos	0
I dont want you doing these	0
But next week you can work 10	0
Hmm	0
I said I love that about my Isaac	0
Yeah	0
Oh I thought you were raising your hand	0
Thank you	0
No	0
If not figure out which one is correct and talk about it	0
Thats a pretty good list	0
Should be four comma one	0
Good	0
You had something different	0
So youve got to try it	0
Haley explain what you did	0
Okay	0
No	0
So youre going to multiply that number by three	0
Youre doing all of it	0
Oh	0
Thank you	0
All right	0
We have inches	0
Same side interior	0
You do not need to write the problem	0
If you remember thats great	0
Zach said something earlier	0
You hang onto that for just a minute	0
Lisa do you need to join me at the front table	0
I appreciate that	0
Im not sure about those	0
Okay	0
So thats that makes it not a function right there	0
So I want you to turn to your eagle partner	0
It does not matter it doesnt matter today	0
Lets decompose this	0
Hows your day off Yesterday	0
Very good	0
Todays lesson is titled Writing Variable Expressions	0
So 3 divided by three is a dollar	0
Now her rule is double the first coordinate grid of all the points	0
So five is still greater than	0
Sitting up straight	0
What we have is part of our sentence	0
Okay so I see exactly half of us say yes this is a function and exactly how to say no this is a function	0
Okay	0
Good	0
She is not	0
Sorry Im looking for something	0
Put it in the rest of them	0
Round it to a whole because its easier	0
Just relax	0
Not going to work	0
So  thank you for clarifying questions Abrahm	0
You can just tell me	0
Look at me	0
You are Oh that homework was a bad thing	0

you always do that secondly like we saw yesterday	0
Okay	0
Now I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12	0
Weve got to be working here	0
So lets go to this last slide and talk about whats gonna happen the next two days and then thats gonna be it for class today	0
in solutions because oh however the middle would be better	0
Yeah number six	0
Im sorry say that again	0
That the red rod is one third  as large as long as the dark green	0
Okay	0
I only wish my little whiteboard would work	0
Alright	0
For example if I rolled a five that means Ive got one chocolate chip for cookie number five	0
No	0
Yes	0
Yes like that	0
Okay	0
T Its just its just its just I couldnt figure out how to do this	0
Yes	0
So ladies and gentlemen those were all of your factor pairs for the number 30	0
A ladder with eight steps	0
Okay	0
Heres where people get a little bit lost	0
So today we already just for the sake of the recording Im going to show you the learning target again	0
If I do it this way	0
Its hard to explain	0
Thats what youre learning today	0
Okay	0
Times 3	0
Im missing a few eyes but really that was good	0
This looks like ancient Egyptians	0
The questions can be read on the worksheet	0
Okay so we have a coordinate grid	0
Good	0
I ve totally forgot our posters were down	0
Ok	0
Yessidy yes	0
They use it but Theres not accepted	0
then he needs to write the word approximate above the equation	0
So that thats a red flag	0
Im getting happier	0
So that tells me gentlemen you are not listening when I talk	0
Oh no	0
But listen to me carefully my friends	0
Uhhuh	0
The next one I did I knew that four goes into five one time and then left 15	0
Please understand the purpose of this	0
We will convert to decimeters	0
Yeah	0
You marked them	0
I don t know how to write that though	0
for that one was nad	0
Right	0
Here we go	0
His large is a quart	0
Okay so just go ahead and graph those points	0
Charlie is going to drink  Im sorry	0
All right	0
13 x 19  13	0
So then we think about the opposite we would have because thats whats missing	0
Sorry three and five sorry Ian three and five pick your partner	0
How does this Okay	0
Ten place	0
It s going to help us talk about some of the main topics for this unit	0
Are you going to come back when	0
So were going to look at three and five here and were going to find a common multiple	0
That may be easier	0
That first one	0
So here is one two three and then I have this piece left over	0
Anyway parts of a set and parts of a whole	0
Okay from there you can play with the information or you can understand the problem	0
A cubed and B cubed	0
Okay	0
I put this this bitmoji up here because I feel like were at the point of the year where perseverance is really paying off	0
I have one piece here 2 3 4	0
And its	0
Fine	0
Okay	0
Lets try this one first	0
Im not wasting more paper	0
Wait what	0
Maybe thats something we need	0
Do your best to get as much done as you can	0
Pink has got it Purples got it Reds got it	0
But we dont know that theyre congruent especially in this like this diagonal right here way shorter than the other diagonal up and down	0
Okay	0
Sh	0
It represents that height of the animals and how many animals have	0
All right youre going to do one more for me very quickly	0
In about 10 minutes Ill be coming by with an exit ticket but you guys work until then	0
Thats a lot of	0
I rounded up by 515s so I need to add that back	0
Both	0
So for the first one all is I want for the first three all is I want is T F F F F F T T T whatever	0
Need partners	0
Its just symmetric	0
Okay	0
I am glad you asked	0
Ten	0
The teacher plans accordingly and orders 85 tickets	0
Important that you understand that	0
Real quick make yourself focus	0
Its Friday Jr today	0
If youre with me write down my four cards	0
Thank you	0
Anne	0
Im telling you there is one fraction that will fit into 12 and 13  evenly so wee what that is	0
Number one	0
And this is C Okay so reminder theres nothing in this sentence that says midpoint or segment bisector	0
Here it is	0
Mrs Strathom I know Im going to need a little help tonight during the homework	0
Lets go to number four	0
Okay	0
This is six sixths	0
So second function On	0
So lets check out number four because I noticed you guys were a little more all over the place when it came to finding 10 of something	0
It was right here	0
No	0
I have a seven in the tens place and a five in the tenths place	0
And you guys each have an assignment to do with that	0
I did a quick average and it was one and a half to two	0
Count these boxes	0
Without talking at your group try to solve this first problem and see if you can label your step like we practiced the other day	0
I just dont really understand	0
Go back to your seats real quick	0
Ready	0
Thank you	0
Thats why you can buy up to 12 apples	0
No	0
So you do 4 x 6 and 4 x 0 and 4 x 5 and so when you did this here that was the problem is that this needs to go here	0
Whining never works with me	0
Two	0
Instead of breaking down were going to say breaking apart	0
Sit quietly please	0
You can either work by yourself or with your table partner	0
All right	0
No	0
But if theyre in the same spot theyre going to be equal	0
Thank you very good	0
the y intercept is 03	0
See if you put this right	0
but theyre not relevant to what you were asked to solve	0
Hmm lets just show all the labels	0
Oh okay	0
Thats great	0
Then if I change A	0
Good	0
Please write times two so we know what were going to do	0
Im going to go	0
You put a red on top	0
It needs to be in your notebook	0
Because youre dividing it into two groups so I know its exactly half	0
Now I need to take a straight edge and connect those	0
Yes I think so	0
She has a really great model to show that	0
Or when I do it	0
Work together on this	0
Im going to say for every	0
The next aStudentsignment	0
Its not loading	0
Its right underneath you sunshine	0
Make sure youre watching the screen or not because you cant mess this up	0
The other one is just the rules	0
So more hands came up now so more people are  agreeing	0
Shh	0
Integers are basically whole numbers	0
There were	0
So this is where they get their onehalf in the example	0
It doesnt matter where you put the one negative sign	0
Im going to check your answer	0
Okay	0
I just pushed record	0
When you partner when you and your partner have it I want you to go to a zero and stand up and push your chairs in	0
Good job	0
5x7 35 6x16 6 will go into 31 five times with 56 left over	0
Five out of 10 is 12345	0
So an equal group	0
I just needed some participation	0
Plus five it needs to be added on	0
Thanks for filling those in	0
Number five has data on this	0
So 34 I would color in I would do the fourths first and Im going to color in one 14 two 14 three 14	0
All right	0
716	0
Kayla would you go ahead and pull a chair up next to Franc so that thats your partner just for this	0
If you guys could already take your homework out in front of you	0
And so the x intercept would be 14 zero	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
So I see	0
Okay but I could do 40 plus five	0
Ruler	0
Other people that I wasnt sure	0
Sure to solve it	0
Minus three that means that I will go in the opposite direction to the left again	0
Okay so if we were if we were estimating the sum or difference for the fraction for each of these number sentences then and then the next thing I need you to do is place an X on the number line to represent your estimate and circle the best answer	0
Last one	0
If were looking at our sixths	0
Right but I want you to make one bigger than that	0
Go	0
A couple of things	0
So this graph shows the balance in a bank account over a period of 14 days	0
Right	0
Those are your sentence starters that you can use when you write your sentences	0
Okay	0
Once again read the prompt multiple times to make sure you understand it underline what the question is asking you circle the relevant information and ask yourself What should my answer look like	0
So lets do that	0
For instance when you do this problem r is 8 x is 5 you should think All right I m going to go like this	0
Wow almost universal	0
On your desks Ive passed out a little sheet of paper and on this little sheet of paper and its really small it says that in solid  threedimensional figure that encloses its face	0
Well really right before special so you can stay on until specials time	0
We have two factors to make and the emphasis on multiplication  the product	0
Cool	0
Alignment	0
Fourth isnt gonna do it	0
5  3 Im just going to write it as 53 because thats 5  3 and thats the same as 1 23	0
Would you run grab my	0
Oliver will you hold the mic up for Liam	0
Hm	0
No these lines arent perfectly parallel so those are going to cross different slopes	0
Yeah what have you written here that s very interesting	0
I am going to help you revise your thinking a little bit	0
So were really not paying any attention to that	0
Eight is closed	0
Okay	0
Thank you	0
Its right there and then go work on that	0
One and then there is onefourth added on to it	0
Okay so	0
Okay	0
Peter looks like I dont see  so if you did some work then make sure On the back side those have to be ratio tables	0
Okay Im going to walk around rather than  Wheres your straight edge Elliot	0
I started at the pizzeria	0
Um and equals question mark	0
Five seven	0
I should have know that	0
Here	0
And that is 24	0
Parkers talking not paying attention	0
Two	0
remember were ignoring the whole right side of this this picture for right now	0
Remember were only trying to equal 12	0
The diagrams you guys have been working with ratio tables and today youre going to go from me helping you set up your ratio tables to you setting up your own ratio tables	0
About	0
It is a negative number but it is okay to have a negative number	0
Okay	0
There you go	0
Wow	0
Okay find the slope of this line	0
Good youre fourth graders thats a good start	0
If you understand it if you dont Im going to have to come to the table	0
Multiplication	0
Two dark blue will fit on top of the yellow	0
She misses one and a half gallons of apple juice with one and a half gallons of fruit juice	0
Are they on	0
Truman use your fingers	0
You represented yourself in front of Ms Perry and all the other teachers with Oh its okay	0
Im not okay with what youve done there	0
That its a linear decrease	0
Please have your book open to page seven	0
This is going to be X and this is going to be Y	0
Okay	0
Im going to give you a couple of examples	0
That look so bad but like we kept getting stuck and  did it	0
So minus five thats your y intercept right here	0
Right	0
Youre like if I just stay at this fast food restaurant Im going to be making a bank but look at what actually happened as you talk about this one	0
Im going to be thinking about watching what shes doing comparing it to your own	0
You did that work also on this problem down here	0
Okay	0
You can keep going you guys can keep going	0
Okay which parts am I allowed to multiply together there	0
So the number I am adding now is 4000ths	0
Lets try this one more time	0
Awesome	0
Five points	0
Were going to quickly talk about eight	0
Thats cool	0
Were starting right now	0
So you just have like your choice of whatever weve been talking about today	0
Another half	0
We probably won t have time for that today	0
Until their intersecting	0
All right	0
So there is a second way that we can find out our mean	0
All right	0
I will show you the image one more time	0
Yeah	0
This data has been ordered from least to greatest for you	0
Showdown	0
Mmhmm	0
I dont know why	0
Yes	0
Im just stating my opinion and my opinion is in the state of the law whatever you say will be held against you in the court of law	0
We had it on the circle	0
Oh 6x12	0
You dont have to do any changing of denominators and there are no whole numbers	0
Youve got to be able to prove your thinking	0
When we are multiplying a fraction by a fraction it is not going to be greater than the original fraction it will be less than	0
Line up at the door for gym	0
First lets read this decimal	0
So Im going to give you guys  so were going to rewatch the videos	0
Hi Liz this is  Im so sorry to bother you	0
Okay um all right	0
Okay so were going to make sure we know how to do this	0
Okay well wrap up class	0
Six correct	0
We are only doing number two	0
Who has a strategy for how we can think about this	0
Excellent	0
One person is going to have to hold it in two places so if Im Tiffany Im going to hold it in the vertex right here and then Im going to hold this side	0
And thanks for your graphing right now	0
I want you to respond to your partner with each problem with either marking it as similar marking it as subject or I would like to add	0
So the dimensions would be how long each side is	0
Darn thats a bargain	0
Good	0
I really really want to see Im going to check number three	0
Those of you that were in your own breakout rooms if you believe youve got this I would like you to just finish the multiplication problem The Division problems	0
Okay	0
I am seeing some confusion	0
Yeah so we already have a common denominator	0
If you would like you can get out a colored pencil so you can use it when comes to shading	0
These are microphones	0
So now this second one this one	0
If for some reason you write a little bit bigger or if my guess is that this doesnt fit exactly on a half sheet well were still going to go with it and you can just grab a second half sheet and turn that all in on it	0
To get from 3 and the 23 put that away please Im going to multiply by 5 so 3 times 5 is 15	0
To the third power	0
Yeah	0
CIndy you get to go first	0
Twenty plus four equals 24	0
After youve done it you write it out	0
The width of my living room is 12 of the length	0
This was  supposed to be a sea monster and this was supposed to be two friends	0
So what do you think five times seven is	0
Okay	0
fraction	0
I would like you to come to this table	0
What is going on	0
So like	0
Yes	0
Thats okay but There were three types of auxiliary lines	0
Hand that to her please	0
River five seconds	0
Three of these doesnt mean the same as three of these	0
I just want to edit  otherwise well just go and well be like Okay a hundred rides	0
Hes sassy	0
I dont know anyone elses	0
The exponents the only thing thats going to change	0
Then we come down here and theyre talking about 45 hundredths	0
All right and then nine times six	0
The new trapezoid is twice as wide as the original trapezoid	0
Lets take a second	0
In a rightangled triangle this side is attached to a right angle	0
No	0
Andrew you say we need one two and three	0
Your graph should look like this	0
Sorry I should have had this ready	0
From here to here	0
Same orange rod were still calling it the  number name one	0
I thought that we were talking the last few minutes before the class ended about rulers	0
We can just go four fifths minus one fifth	0
So Johnson Im gonna steal yours cuz it looks really nice	0
Okay	0
Just checking	0
And then this is telling me I want Xs that are smaller than three	0
58	0
Shed say Why	0
Okay so lets try it out	0
I was doing some thinking	0
Divided it up into I just did groups of one because 33 is the same as one	0
We are looking at page 159	0
No wait	0
Well look at the data that he gives me to figure out what its not picking up or what it is picking up	0
I know its two	0
Yep this is the answer D You are all over the place except for doing math right now	0
Theres 100SStotal	0
I want you to try and think your numbers in your head	0
Order Its to arrange things according to a specific rule often from smallest to largest or from largest to smallest	0
It was point four	0
The 23 and 49  you triple the 3 to get 9 then you have to triple the two to get 6 so 69 and	0
And it would be 76 and two thirds	0
All right people so we are going to watch a very quick video	0
Thats the second problem  the second problem	0
It becomes 60 degrees	0
Okay	0
Its not always	0
Then two pouches then two pouches here so you cross out that cross out those two and cross out those two and you are left with one pouch and nine coins	0
Leave a blank between the two	0
This one youre just going to pick which one of these	0
S is zero five	0
Thats right	0
You may as well	0
I have two groups of five	0
Because Dr Martino didn t see  this and I think she ll want to see it	0
Okay	0
What are they painting	0
Okay	0
Now here you extend the same scheme	0
Lets do it	0
Hold on were not talking to our partner yet	0
Because and represents a decimal	0
Could you write it down on your chart	0
All right	0
Okay	0
Okay were looking pretty good here	0
Were not having that discussion	0
Once you get it make sure your name is at the top	0
So I will go to eight take half is four count the rods multiply by two subtract two and then add three	0
Solve showing your solution strategies	0
In the first two problems of this investigation the coordinates grid is in the form of a street map of a fictional city called Euclid	0
If you look at the top of your sheet it says cards and it gives you four blank spots	0
Alright and Asher I want to ask you a question right now	0
Yes	0
That would be very interesting	0
Ezra says if we have nine itll work	0
Nice	0
Add up our outside	0
Okay	0
Youre basically labeling your colored paper	0
Haley I saw a light bulb go on	0
Heres your problem what youre doing	0
Now we have a different case	0
So thats the first one in the table	0
Im want everyone to look at Number 3	0
Okay Im just looking	0
Uh uh in the front so we call uh we can find the answer positive	0
Thirtytwo	0
Theres another house one more house with two people that represents this house right here	0
You may	0
So we got to remember that our final answer is going to be a negative slope and the rise is negative nine	0
Okay	0
There you go	0
We want to quickly talk about this	0
Is it still fun	0
Two and 49 hundredths	0
To get from 180 to 207 I need 27 more	0
So maybe if I count up by 20 so I say 100 20 40 60 80 100	0
Now I want you to think of another example here	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Thats very interesting	0
Oh 32 is the cell phone one	0
12th person comes along closes number 12	0
Yes because if dog does two tricks	0
I just see your name and I think Simon	0
I just said it	0
8 times 1100ths	0
Mmhm	0
You are so fast for me	0
Take another piece of paper if you want to because it sounds  like your approach is a little different	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
So 5 is going to look like this	0
Okay	0
Its just that theres this line and this line but okay	0
For this and then	0
You bring down the decimal	0
Yes	0
All right	0
Okay	0
So write down what that would be	0
I told you guys it was gonna be a long time until we talked about them	0
Theres a new rule	0
Oh I did Im so sorry	0
Okay	0
So in third grade we were doing a good job of drawing dots and counting them	0
Why is it not over yet	0
Alright so heres what were going to do	0
I will have my first group that is done to do the same thing stand somewhere in the room	0
Okay	0
Ms Strathom Ill also need Missy to be at the table  so go ahead and	0
Interpolate	0
Now just tap the board somewhere	0
My answer was 5994	0
Yeah	0
S stands for no	0
Because they  in them and you might get confused if you want to use one or more	0
Then would you pass it back while doing that	0
stick	0
4 x 6 is 24	0
Come on buddy	0
So that would be 156 if we divide by two	0
We can use this ratio to determine how many people could fit into 8 yerts	0
Im going to send you into breakout rooms to review this	0
If we just line these decimals up so your decimals there	0
Nice	0
I dont know if these actually are	0
Five four three two one	0
Okay so the first algorithm that we used was Zoey called Technically I think we did trade first but if you just do it one pair at a time a place value at a time then its US tradition	0
Then you connect um the top point to the bottom right point of the sixcentimeter line	0
And now were done with person 16	0
Eight right	0
And now Jim has Jim has 1  fewer	0
Not sure	0
A four	0
So if you take a look at this equation here and you divide the whole thing by five because all of them have fives in it then you get a way simpler version of this equation	0
Give me five	0
Use your calculator to find the answer for those and take off when youre finished	0
Okay	0
The hypotenuse is this one	0
Now it doesnt matter which ear you want to put it in its the same thing	0
Every other	0
Everyone needs to join	0
All of them	0
You can look at these and I do want everyone to write these in if you havent	0
A couple of extra letters in here	0
It looks like they make up other shapes but I would say nine	0
Theres four warmup questions up here	0
Um it makes no big difference what you fill in on the vertical axis as long as youre taking the same steps every time	0
Youre going to work with Kayla and Hudson because you were not there yesterday	0
Thank you very much James	0
Okay	0
Just pick one of the squares and do it	0
Theres a smiley face thats reflected	0
Its the same thing on the board dont need to look at your paper	0
This is exactly a square so that is nine times nine	0
Look what I did	0
So this student	0
Ashley lets look at yours since youre more comfortable with yours	0
Im going to shade all the way to 56	0
All right showdown	0
Okay bye	0
If I take this 100 I have to think about how I got there	0
I believe theres two purple	0
Number one 6 and 7851000 is greater than 6 and 79100	0
Then look carefully at your answers and talk with a partner about what you learned	0
Yeah	0
Start with the whole	0
Okay	0
Can we show it anyway we want	0
Work on them with a partner or partners and only one packet per two three people and we will work on those together	0
Yeah	0
Put it where it belongs please	0
Yep	0
Sometimes and I know youve all seen it theyll ask you to find the sum of two numbers	0
See if you can figure it out	0
Work with whoever you would like	0
So domain is Xs range is ys	0
Okay because the bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces	0
Pick it up pretty quickly	0
That is one two three four five six seven eight nine problems	0
I m going backwards	0
Can I just use that one	0
Do divided by so now you do 262	0
So just mentally prepare yourself for that	0
All right	0
I know this is very interesting and I  know we want to continue this	0
So a number means like you put a letter	0
Hi lovey	0
Five and six its not gonna be 56	0
And you are absolutely 100 right	0
Please cover your work while you are writing	0
And thats youre actually saying yards squared	0
So while everyone else is still writing this down lets look at these steps	0
Yes	0
Well there is one minute of remaining time	0
In this one he has 400 but he earns 10 every day	0
10 ounces	0
Now could one just write absolute solution value 14	0
If we subtract nine to make it a little bit more simple as well well get 3x plus three y equals 171	0
That is the easier way to do it	0
Outside the classroom I dont really know	0
Yeah	0
You probably thought of it wrong	0
Youre gonna get negative two when you divide it	0
Well watch this cool thing	0
Okay	0
I want you guys to hold up what youre working	0
Were trying to share our math thinking right now not having a whole side conversation to be videotaped to see how fast we can be	0
All right	0
We already had that	0
Im going to zoom in a little bit here	0
And then those that arent even trying to do this	0
On the math test a lot of people	0
So then 20 needs to go up against the eight	0
And my hint for you on this one Im gonna draw a dashed line here	0
Please stop	0
Yes	0
Im doing	0
Okay	0
Thank you for building on that	0
Those of you that are going to work with me Keep your cameras on	0
Those of you guys that are done I want you to go ahead and pull up your slides from yesterday even if you finish them	0
Yes	0
So that means 34 yerts will accommodate 204 people	0
Jaden who did you talk with	0
And for 12 I could say 12 24 oh but I can stop there and thats a common multiple between the two of them so thats the number that Im going to use for their denominators	0
But I drink probably lets say a half a cup a day	0
Yeah	0
to your answer	0
Homework is being turned in please	0
Divide by 2	0
Alright	0
I thought that you mentioned	0
You dont change it at the negative two part	0
Oh yes	0
Thats all right	0
Yes youre going to turn it all the way up	0
Okay	0
Please hold	0
That was in the sent the story	0
Youre absolutely right but explain in a little more detail	0
Youre not talking anymore	0
It sure is	0
You should	0
So y equals 3x plus one	0
Then all of a sudden we get to here boom it crosses at two points	0
And as a suggestion as a suggestion the factor X is put up front already	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
So the y intercept is always zero comma a number	0
They love that	0
Clap back both of you both of you clap back	0
Okay	0
Really were just going down by three by two every time	0
The next day the next day after the other day	0
And you and Mrs Moore are going to sit reading a book	0
Does everybody have a partner	0
Her example was changing a 10 into a 100	0
Its like little penguin eyes	0
So I have groups of two and one threesome	0
So the first thing Im going to ask you is if Jake wants to make a larger book for his folder write on your whiteboard what he needed to do with those grids	0
Okay	0
So we already know the y intercept	0
Now do not worry about this right now	0
And A times	0
Im actually going to send these things back now with another guy and just get you slotted with our main package	0
You couldve	0
People who write it like this are okay	0
You can look	0
Its really difficult especially when were working with fractions	0
9 divided by 3 is 3 and 12 divided by 3 is 4	0
We have three of the eight pieces that we would need to have our next group so this is three but a whole group is made up of eight pieces	0
Or I have five groups of one	0
Oh	0
it could be just a segment	0
Okay	0
If we take a look now how would we know the least account balance	0
So that what this says is	0
Okay you and I are going to work together	0
Okay	0
You ve got it OK let s get it down	0
So the next page is really fun	0
Oh thank you	0
I like that I saw Carmen she said that this is really just on four	0
So just looking at this already is three fifths bigger	0
Just try to have productive math conversations	0
You just need to connect the dots now	0
Okay so you didnt read it	0
Mmhm	0
six cents	0
And there was inaudible y equals 90	0
Well what did what did you do	0
Anyway	0
The only reason why you actually shouldnt have done that in this particular exercise is because that little plus sign is the only thing that was given in print	0
So cute	0
All you need to do there is to fill in a 10 in the place of the X	0
And so	0
Our next step change any mixed numbers to improper fractions	0
Be prepared to share your thinking with a partner	0
Emily Zoe your are a group	0
And today is a pretty good day to work on using the typing tool by the way especially for like these blanks because thatll make it go a little bit faster	0
All right	0
Ha ha	0
You are going to look closely at this problem	0
Oh my God	0
Over here it has 10 divided into five groups give a reason gives a result of two per group	0
Responsibility	0
Precisely	0
Spin the wheel	0
Its the same going down	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
I think Aaron on the right track Stephanie	0
So if youre one of those people inauisble to campus come up with a plan to get that assignment done	0
You guys are going to have to do this independently	0
If your partner is close you can just move your desk over but if your partner is far away just move your chair	0
So your slope is one half or 05	0
Oh is that	0
Dont just automatically assume its hard	0
I watched it on YouTube	0
Because this is telling us 45 divided by five	0
All right	0
Okay	0
And I would like you to estimate the sum by naming the benchmark	0
I think weve used the word point before	0
I think this the one I taught yesterday	0
And Im going into the end zone	0
We need some stars for Andrea	0
I am at 28 but theres a few things I dont understand	0
Okay	0
So its going to go through all five points at this point and then its off for all the other ones	0
I dont I dont hear you say that	0
Ten	0
Otherwise I would be the first one to turn it off	0
Okay	0
Well now I want to right down a problem and see if somebody can tell me right away what the answers are	0
From Santa Barbara to Oakland oh my goodness its nine hours 57 by train 53 by bus	0
Your slope is 31 or you could do 93 or you could do 62 its all the same thing and you get 3 again for your slope	0
You want to write it	0
And five times six is thirty	0
And then thats going to be a same side interior with this one	0
Were going to continue drawing diagrams or pictures today	0
Okay	0
Those are all of the factor pairs for the number 56	0
Thats the way I want you to think about a number line we were rounding up and down	0
So then my next process is this now I need to add these two together	0
All right	0
But I dont know that you dont understand something because your one partners doing all the work	0
When picking a partner I know that Missy is my very best friend in the world but if I dont understand what the problem is asking me to do Im going to find a partner that might be able to help me	0
Back in your desks	0
Okay how about you and Gage	0
Its a different way to make a model	0
Oh	0
Nice	0
And then if you take 900 minus 800 I get 100	0
With your fractions	0
Im going to turn	0
As I start out going with eight and seven	0
And two	0
Those are the different kinds of situations	0
Theres too many people back there for me	0
You said something	0
I said the wrong page	0
Its  just putting in number names now	0
Oh no wait thats Pacific	0
So I need you to find come on bookmark	0
So you might just want to watch on mine	0
When youre having a mathematical conversation you are expanding your mathematical knowledge by having a great conversation	0
Gage Blake and Landon	0
And then	0
While I might have a little bit stronger math skills than Hadley at this point in our lives she has just a good a chance of winning because she could draw better cards than I will	0
Nope it says my rule is bigger the denominators smaller the divisor	0
But wouldnt it be 11 there because	0
Did everybody get papers	0
I want you to explain what you did	0
Im sure Andrew will lend you a few if you want to complete your  model	0
So well write that in a second	0
Youre close on these equations	0
Over here uh it is uh four by minus 12	0
Ill explain what I mean by that	0
For a vertical asymptote were trying to say where is the vertical line that the function cannot cross	0
1 2 3	0
So for example in draw we can draw a picture of this	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Okay	0
Ok Im going to call that  train 1	0
Oblique asymptote	0
Theres another example of another one of his puns	0
In royal families is it always fair	0
It makes sense because I did eight times the 10 first when I was supposed to do eight times the one first	0
Youre on the right track	0
Notice they gave one of their bullet points and proved where it happened in both articles	0
Thank you	0
Excellent	0
So its asking you to look at it as the theme	0
So you would	0
Oh yeah four	0
Since we only have a half meter and were dividing that into thirds each one is a sixth	0
Um four oranges and two purples	0
One two	0
Okay so I kept sharing This is what I noticed when I was walking around	0
Thats an awesome strategy	0
And what I will say is the Monday assignments are worth even more points than your normal homework usually is because the Monday assignments are all worth 10	0
Okay	0
Thats fine	0
And Ill trust you on that	0
X axis	0
You also need to be able to interpret your remainder	0
Try it	0
Before the end of the week were going to be able to say At y equals Figure out what the actual oblique asymptote is going to be	0
Excellent	0
So lets go ahead and our problem here is three divided by twothirds	0
So lets see if you can figure them out	0
You put your Just pick a mark on grid one right now	0
Okay	0
If it was an eight pack youre right about that	0
40	0
Over here one two three four	0
So we can just go ahead and rewrite all of these	0
Estimating	0
Youre coming in here smiling at me	0
And Hudsona you are really close on your table but Im going to show you	0
And nobody  can persuade you that you re wrong	0
And we are out of here three minutes and 40 seconds early for today	0
So it would be twice as wide and the same height	0
Its greater than 90 degrees	0
Two fraction addition problems	0
Then I split half of that	0
Its just like a fraction	0
So lets say Im feeling really ambitious and Im going to do two a day workouts	0
I got 150240	0
Thank you	0
Yeah	0
Okay I think you guys are right	0
Cool	0
Okay	0
Hold on	0
Oh come on	0
4 x 3 is 12	0
I will develop and apply a rule to enlarge a picture on a coordinate grid	0
And Y equals zero means youre not going up or down from that center line	0
And this one is not correct either	0
The fraction gets closer and closer to zero	0
Clay one larger and one smaller	0
What Let me see	0
You were only supposed to do one so therefore youre not following directions	0
Okay	0
Understanding why we did what we just did is what you have to understand to make partial products work	0
I got 6 because of 13 of 6	0
I cant take four from one	0
And also similarly the other ones where it gets won by the home team	0
I have 34 so Im going to color in my 34 that I have	0
Oh man I think I got the blood in your brain flowing today	0
Im gonna go buy a nice house fancy car and maybe Ill get my toilet made of solid gold that Ive always wanted who knowsOkay thats todays lesson	0
You can find this method after doing some calculations	0
You get a raise	0
Nope	0
Lets graph this	0
Thats smart	0
Yeah	0
This is the last edition problem we are going to do together then were going to skip to a subtraction problem and talk about that	0
You cant see it on yours	0
Okay	0
Well Im I didnt mind your other example here	0
One of my	0
One10th	0
One can also do minus five	0
Write them down on your notes because you cant use your head on the test if you don t use your note	0
He wants to be on camera	0
This is 90 degrees	0
Sorry crew	0
You have to plot those three equations	0
Two to the fourth is 16	0
So just be aware of that	0
I see here Rachel has started	0
So every in and out box they will put some numbers in here to give you clues on how to solve it in an in and out box so lets do so	0
It looks like you subtracted seven from eight and you ll get a one	0
Oh okay	0
So thats over here	0
Lets go on to number four	0
Okay	0
Im just asking you to repeat what they just said	0
So the y intercept is 03	0
Theres one word that means the exact same thing	0
20 okay	0
Which way is it	0
I think your screenshot were all here	0
So x can be two or x can be six	0
Okay	0
Yeah no I havent been that good	0
Okay	0
That was a homework	0
I think that its important that you actually explain what youre doing	0
Ella bought 78 of a a yard of fabric to make a pillowcase	0
I  don t seem to see it up there	0
You had 12 of something you split that 12 in 12 made it a 14	0
No	0
Now lets do this one	0
Okay	0
There are no mixed numbers in this example so we dont have to do that step	0
They meant the same thing Okay	0
Sponsor A based on the graph every one kilometer it goes up 3	0
hundredths is a number so that is awesome	0
If you have compared them you are going to look at the third one or the fourth one	0
How many bags we can make from 135 marbles	0
Be seated when youre done	0
Thats is tomorrow	0
53 because you	0
Your problem says Andre and Han are moving boxes	0
Is that Collin	0
A clear picture	0
Take 30 seconds	0
Dont second guess yourself	0
So were going to actually work on one problem that requires a little bit more thinking	0
So I have to move them to my answer	0
Thanks	0
right	0
Okay this is a pretty quick store visit though	0
Thats it for that question	0
No 65	0
I think we can do a little better	0
Im going to circle 12	0
Thats another piece of the lesson today	0
And this one right here is all of your coursework and all of your quizzes	0
Okay and I am happy to work at the front	0
Elijah dont touch that	0
You have one more	0
Lets just double check	0
All right fraction problems part one	0
Hes one of the people And they go in to decide which companies they would like to invest in	0
It is helping you look at no different than Mr Mason walking in going T you did a great job showing the process for two digit multiplication	0
There you go	0
Okay	0
If we think about something that is the size of 14 its going to fit in one two times	0
If I can get you to move just somewhere that Im not going to step on you	0
But he might beat you up if its too hard	0
What is your favorite way to eat a basketball	0
And thats the linear part	0
With this notation	0
Sums is division	0
Good	0
Okay so our ear looks like this	0
Okay	0
5 4	0
Well if we think about I would be really careful to just look for specific words but it would say something about how can we divide things up into groups	0
This is much easier	0
Thats why this equation wont work because if I have to add two thirds plus a half its going to equal more than one and the one is the land	0
Most people have a lot of experiences with a sphere	0
No because twofourths is a half	0
When you solve problems you work to make sense of a problem	0
Were going to try one just now	0
Ill let it go	0
I loved pies I loved pizza cut it into pieces make it give that many people the pieces	0
Thats how we learn the best way	0
Okay	0
I want you to finish this sentence	0
Those of you that believe Sadie is right please start to wrap up your conversations and make your final points	0
I need you  to help me straighten out some things in my head and if you can  help me straighten them out in my head you may be helping out  other people straighten them out also	0
Youll have a pair of parentheses and be able to calculate it	0
That that would be the number	0
that ones gonna go there	0
Okay	0
Um okay	0
Okay	0
That would be a day	0
There you are	0
Show me you can go back without talking	0
Open	0
And then one times three is	0
Did you pick out one to solve over there	0
Alright so some reminders and announcements for you	0
How many white roses did she buy	0
Youre seeing how much she ate of the whole	0
Okay	0
So remember with ratio tables I usually give you lots of squares in case you need them	0
I want you to think about what our learning objective is today	0
Everyone make it count one	0
That is how you multiply a whole number times a fraction which is a lesson coming on later this unit	0
Okay	0
Just	0
So Penelope says she tried this	0
You need to practice all those fancy words that you know	0
No one should be working on anything other than that because heres what I noticed some people are doing the next one the exact same way but they didnt read what the rule was	0
Youve gotten to a good point in the problem	0
The ninetysixth angle	0
Thank you	0
Interesting question	0
This is cool I can do this	0
Okay	0
We are going to give number names to all those really really little lines	0
Because two whites  two whites	0
And you proved it	0
What were going to do is Im going to go back into presentation mode	0
Ok I am hearing some interesting arguments  here	0
You got it	0
I dont think so	0
We might this afternoon but what were going to look at is are these problems acting up for LCM or GCF	0
No youre turning an improper fraction into a mixed number	0
There are some sentences starting I think that all of the exterior angles will	0
No	0
which is 35 so isnt that how you get the 35 instead of 34	0
So if you rent 1 DVD for Online Flix you pay 12 a month even if you dont rent anything	0
I promise	0
Okay	0
You got it	0
Can I turn my thing back on	0
Yes	0
You dont need to know that in math one	0
Begin	0
For the rally coach part	0
Theres a lot of cards in these	0
Martin this one and this as well	0
You will get your note catcher out and open up to page I think its seven	0
Okay	0
Friend one gets this one	0
The answer is a trick question or youre answering two separate questions	0
That is very very substantial	0
All of those things fall under a category	0
Thats a lot of just kind of random information about the coordinate plane but I think thats good information to start off for today	0
Rock its a rock	0
Now were at 246	0
So using one of those symbols your job is to tell me what makes that a true number sentence	0
Voices are off	0
Oh so you just picked a number	0
Youre multiplying the same numbeTeacher except in different order	0
Who didnt	0
So lets think about why this answer is correct	0
Okay	0

Georgia Im not sure what it is that youre doing over there but you need to shut that because nowhere in my directions did I say Please play with your Chromebooks	0
We have three in this numerator we have one in this numerator	0
I would advise you to use an area model because I know that you guys are really good	0
I think maybe leaves	0
Its very important that you expand it	0
If I look between one and two Im going to divide it in half and then divide it in fourths	0
Look we originally had it cut into eight pieces	0
Lets try the other one	0
David is sure	0
I started  with addition I added to eight times then I added these two I got 16 so I put the six here to carry the one up there then I added the one	0
They did not use the same unit fraction more than once in the sum	0

Um I think I am still missing a few	0
Find the common denominator	0
On a graph what that means is we are getting this kind of behavior	0
Okay Im just gonna keep talking	0
Notice it says They did not use the same unit fraction more than once	0
So be aware of that	0

Up by one for X up by four why that should be a before while getting all mixed up here	0
And since this is consistent its the same thing every time	0
Okay so were going to read about	0
Okay	0
When were multiplying order doesnt matter	0
I dont know who this is from	0
If X is 14 lets solve for Y	0
Thats two thats three	0
Okay so thats a four a half one	0
Yup	0
Like this	0
opposite sides are congruent because its a parallelogram	0
Thats what I was looking for you to say okay Scott	0
Very interesting	0
All right people Id like you to turn to your table partner	0
Ill take volunteers	0
Six	0
So I need you really to be thinking about these numbers and the picture and what was meant by them	0

Once youre done having your conversation please go back to your seat	0
She spent half of that at the candy shop	0
H is negative two comma four	0
It would be twelve	0
Then she got the concept of how to find the common denominator but she didnt understand how to get the numerator the way she needed it but she kept asking questions and she kept persisting	0
Listen up	0
So she took three she took one whole away from that three making it a two but its only three plus the one which makes it four	0
Shes saying so if I call this six now  shed call that five	0
Yes	0
One half	0
Which activity is it	0

Why or why not	0
Heres two wholes	0
So that we knew the answer to this is 38	0
So Ill write it down	0
Im not asking what you accidentally did	0
Well and theres the thing	0
Thats what I needed to know	0
so then I subtract them	0
When we talk about these diagrams we talk about using ratio tables	0
One	0
All right hopefully everyones good with that	0
Yes	0
Part of our goal today is to learn how to use ratios to compare things	0
Maybe you have to think about how you are solving that	0
No	0
If they dont draw the same as what youve got it wasnt	0
We have a one	0
Yes	0
If nineteen was eighteen it would have worked	0
When it says to make it larger does it mean it as making it taller and wider or both	0
Now that everything is neat and organized add up your answers go	0
Yes Bob had 10 pizza pies	0
Right	0
Okay	0
And then for thirds	0
Yes	0
It says that the red circle as a whole we can show two and oneforth like this then you can split it up in fourths then you can leave with your pieces	0
We will not use it anymore	0
We did this one first where they give you the perimeter and you have to figure out the area when only one sides given	0
Okay	0
Yes	0
Yes	0
We can just add our X and Y because we start at  our origin	0
We compared number of words spoke on a	0
We know the perimeter of a square	0
Lets say I have two glasses of water but me and three of my friends are thirsty we each would get a half	0
No keep it out on your  Oh youve got	0
Dont just wing it	0
Jonathan can you	0
By yourselves you are going to do page 164 problem one A B C Youre going to compare those answers and help one another if there is a misunderstanding	0
If it gets a frowning crying face you need to go figure out whats going on	0
No I think	0
Now uh some of you have got some very clever things but you are writing them in words	0
So	0
You werent there because	0

You may begin go	0
Hm	0
Anyone else need a colored pencil	0
You could	0
I feel like I saw a lot of light bulbs going off when were working on that	0
You can use your strategy	0
Try and explain it in a way in which a few more people will say that they understood	0
Well your stomach	0
I like your thinking	0
Youre logging Y every single time Finn	0
Nice	0
You guys may calculate that one yourselves real neat	0
31100	0
Down 3 down 3 down 3	0
Find the common denominator	0
You fill in onethird which which is bigger than than onetwelfth	0
All right	0
So	0
Youre going to have a fair chunk of time but use your time wisely	0
Im giving you specifics	0
If I write something like this let me switch colors	0

Erase your boards clean	0
Okay	0
Put your pencils down all I want you to do right now is listen	0
30 x 70 30 x 4 8 x 70 8 x 4	0
Over here if I add all those up are the same numbers everybody look 200 240 100 12	0
So my division is done	0
Thats an acceptable answer	0
Guess what you do in your thinking box	0
Ankur would you erase the  in that whole section	0
Oh no well live even if it did	0
Check out this one	0
If you decided that you wanted to do a value ordered bar graph for this you would need to remember that you have a bar that goes all the way to 12 and then another one that goes all the way to 11	0
Then when you find your common denominator you have 1624 minus 924	0
Thats okay	0
So we get negative 34	0
Oh I realized this is a stick but Ill just use this one	0
Come on	0
Its by sharing strategies	0
Have you tried it for any other numbers to  see if it works	1
Any questions	1
Does this have a half by the way	1
Then um right around here on the handout okay	1
Am I holding up one whole	1
Stand up please	1
All right so Margo you are up	1
Everybody say Multiplicative identity property	1
And youre saying if you have if you take one half thats all right	1
Horizontal	1
Above number seven somebody raise their hand and read the directions for me please	1
No	1
Hm well where is it the same area with this triangle	1
Do you understand that	1
Am I going to make it	1
Can we fill another one on a whole nother	1
Once youve got it turn and talk	1
The equation right	1
Okay one times two is two correct	1
Dottie are you done	1
Can you say that again  what number names gave to each of those rods so I can hear from  back here	1
Way longer	1
Royce Im coming to you	1
You mean that	1
Seveneighths is closer to one than it is half and fivesixths is closer to one than it is half then its pretty much one minus one	1
Negative 25	1
Have you used the multiplication table before	1
Its not the question	1
Can you still do an estimate for number four	1
Were going to look at a new street where should this street be located	1
Smaller	1
Do you remember	1
Do you think you can explain it	1

Raise your hand	1
Okay so the answer is nine	1
You dont know my full expectations do you	1
Yes because if we do this as a picture would we have any whole pieces	1
Now do you mean at the listing	1
The fact is these are the ones were going to use from now on okay	1
Okay Jeremy	1
Heres what Ill show you The brackets	1
You re calling this one right	1
Why would it be better to start at 21 than 22	1
What	1
Understand	1
Who wants to go next	1
Do you understand why Im saying your division was not complete	1
Dont do that okay	1
Obtain the area of triangles which are in the places in the parallel lines	1
Okay Connie	1
No go ahead	1
But I m confused	1
You drew this and this	1
You click on Investigation 3 and then its the last one right here okay	1
Did anybody else do this	1
Prism Tom	1
So we already kind of have an idea about these two fractions right	1
Three wholes	1
Turn and talk to your neighbor	1
Yes	1
We can do it right	1

Go	1
Foxs the only one really	1
Did anybody look at this from the very first step and think about distributing that tangent to both of those	1
Did you understand why	1
Kyle	1
The last one we had What was the last problem we had	1
Remember	1
Talk as a table	1
Go ahead	1
How far are you	1
Im thinking you would have probably one sixth	1
Did anyone think about that	1
Okay will you which one are you doing	1
It would probably be a much much bigger because if the model is  say this big it would need more reds and more whites than these   cause these are small	1
Im sorry	1
Who can read this question for me	1
Do I	1
Faith	1
Yeah	1
It also could be can you make a half out of a bunch of different a half with a bunch of different denominators	1
It s a different way isn t it	1
No	1
Ringing a bell	1
Decimals go here right	1
Six plus four equals ten	1
All right you know what to do	1
Whats going on and  whats your name	1
No	1
It looks like too bad	1
Youve been counting by five probably since you were five years old right	1
Are you ready	1
Nikolai	1
Nobody wants to try	1
I did it the um	1
Each column is worth one tenth right	1
So one and seven sixths is the same as two and one six right	1
Levi lets start with you	1
Samuel said   Samuel go ahead you have your hand in the air	1
How many had it	1
Does this make sense	1
Okay what were we stuck on	1
Alright so Austin turn your mic on	1
Luke	1
Landon turn your microphone back on	1
Leung Hoi Chung	1
Faith	1
And whos sharing	1
Henry do you agree disagree or have a question	1
What I added to 112 was 412	1
The price of the pears and the price of the persimmons and even the basket will be included as well this time right	1
Pam ta da pam pam	1
Franc	1
Nobody in there has a problem with the way I wrote this question	1
Does that make sense	1
Myra	1
What	1
And its bigger than that	1
That is for odd numbers right	1
Not no you dont have to but that is the reason why when we do these box plots yeah	1
Did you have five and 13 divided by 35 as your sentence	1
You have an answer but you dont feel confident	1
Who s doing the talking you doing the talking	1
Oh dont you know it	1
Okay Zoe John come here	1
The square of A equals nine okay	1
Erik do  you want to say that one more time	1
We said not the same	1
Yes Austin	1
So its not 61000ths	1
Before we start who would like to read the first one	1
Jackie	1
Are you done	1
How are you feeling right now	1
Does that kind of make sense	1
So then when I do this when I put four in I get sixteen minus sixty is that right	1
You see how you need to write that	1
How many people actually did their box and whisker plot yesterday or last night for homework	1
Rebecca	1
Tera and Kayla youre not done	1
Takes a lot doesn t it	1
Think of your number line okay	1
Now Denisa will go up to the board	1
Wait was I wrong in that last one	1
You should label one whole and under it put three thirds	1
Any other questions	1
Dawud could you tell us what Ariel said	1
Okay Ava	1
This is the one for nine	1
Read the second bullet with me	1
Adrian how are you doing with that	1
Excuse me	1
You found them	1
Monday youre taking level threes you will come in here the room will be in nice neat rows and good old Mr Huff will be your Mr Strathom okay	1
You think 20 is the answer	1
I might say Okay were going to do page What were we on 140	1
Five	1
Christina	1
thumbs up when you are done	1
Andrew	1
The question is what it is right	1
Is the fraction	1
The dotted lines	1
How did it go Jacob	1
Nick	1
Which one would you like to do	1
Give me a thumbs up when youre done writing this so that I know that youre ready to move on to the next step	1
You were able to make this a triangle right	1
Stand by your desk and show youre ready to look	1
Paycheck right	1
Did anybody else multiply instead of just adding up	1
Easy enough right	1
Ten times	1
You can go up here and then around here to the grocery store	1
Do you want to work on new sailboat one or do you want to jump in where Liz and Louis are and work on a new sailboat	1
Go ahead Sarah	1
Okay apply who can read the word apply in yellow Nadia	1
You get Does that make sense to you	1
Jean	1
Does everybody notice how its moving this way	1
I have to move it one right there correct	1
Huh	1
You can use different models that are theyre the same	1
Yes	1
Olivia okay are you done with the area	1
Okay tell me how you feel	1
Corey go for it	1
Now over here 24 right	1
Does anybody have any questions so far before we finish off the equation	1
Does that sound good so far everybody	1
Do you know	1
Alex	1
Talk to the partner go	1
No	1
One times 12 equals 12	1
Coordinates	1
Its going to be on a quiz next week al right	1
I think five	1
Yes	1
What	1
How about not doing it exact okay	1
Okay you ready	1
Can I get Joanne	1
But maybe um you want to come  up here and do that	1
The angles everybody agree these angles are the same	1
fraction	1
Vance	1
I need to add those together right	1
How many of you drew a graph	1
Did anybody tackle the hamster problem	1
Pedro do you have something to add or you have a question	1
Yes maam	1
77	1
Would you  expect one model to come up with something different than the  other	1
Go	1
Kate	1
Im going to give you 3 minutes well see where were at Okay	1
So their distance	1
Do you think thats gonna be a big part of fourth grade	1
Did you say it because they all said it	1
Well think about this as the base do we know the base	1
Logan can I see those circles	1
It wont at least overlap right	1
Patrick	1
How many of you remember	1
Gabby	1
The answer to our multiplication problem right	1
Stephen I havent heard a lot from you today	1
Ava	1
This is the smaller brothers right	1
Yes	1
Is the computer always right	1
See	1
Well I dont know exactly but it would be a lot	1
Everybody agrees so far	1
Brielle	1
Numerator divided by denominator right	1
How many of you think its one tenth	1
Yeah but what would you do for the four game series	1
Caleb	1
Martin	1
Hello	1
David	1
Is there somebody that wants to read that one out loud to us	1
10 questions	1
Next person	1
Lets get started with Isaac	1
Six plus six five plus five	1
Kailey	1
Arent you	1
Is that true	1
Space	1
Do we have anything to back up either one of those more than the other	1
1 if we were looking at the tangent of 1 we wouldnt be saying how big is the red line compared to the green line	1
Youre adding	1
Did you subtract by two	1
Theres a lot right	1
Yes I got it	1
All of these  represent one is that a surprise	1
Stop	1
third side 123123 Are these the same triangles	1
We just kept on adding	1
All right so what I did is I took my fifths right	1
You think its this	1
Im sorry	1
She used 45 of it and to tie a bow on a large gift how much ribbon does she use	1
David	1
Why are you confused	1
Asher	1
They are different right	1
Go	1
Say that one more time David	1
Because if you add the denominator	1
This would also read as 12 of 5 right	1
Anybody	1
What	1
But in the morning of some day okay	1
Beth  This is a ten and ten of these equal to one	1
Is that really fair	1
Its like this right	1
But I guess Im asking the question uh to Meredith and James  and to Erik and Alan right now uh does this have anything to do  with your theory and the theory you tested	1
Could we walk through all of them	1
If he thought that 1 cup only 1 cup of cream goes into the whole recipe	1
Yes	1
are the numbers in my 624 ever going to go up against each other	1
Matt	1
What do you think James	1
One out of six is an equivalent fraction to 212 right	1
12 so do you see friends	1
Do you have any questions about this stuff	1
Youre stuck on the converting part	1
What about perimeter	1
Did that help you then	1
Is it going to be a whole number is it going to be a fraction	1
Is that s what s confusing you	1
Did you do that	1
Is three hats for 15 the ratio	1
Do I expect you all the time to solve these with fraction circles	1
Next week are we going to all participate	1
Snobbishly	1
I have nine boxes right	1
Starting out at 10 instead of zero is that a similar problem	1
Do you understand what I mean	1
Do the green dot and the purple dot have the same cosine right now	1
Everyone say length times width	1
So do you have it correct or not	1
We have been working on those quite a bit am I correct	1
At the grocery store	1
Herve	1
Then how about this side	1
This is right this way isnt it	1
Because if these are going to be between 3 12 3 and 3 12 or 3 12 and 4 right	1
you have a question	1
If our learning objective is to divide and if I know I need to be able to justify what the difference in these two things are am I gonna work on division	1
No	1
So I  know  but I tried addition because I knew  and I know thats wrong but I was going to try	1
Law Oi Ping	1
Questions	1
Alan	1
Connor	1
No cuz 26 divided by two is 13 hours right	1
Youre finished	1
No it says predict	1
So what are you going to feel	1
Lets start with our first row here does anyone have questions on our first row here	1
Teacher	1
Does that make sense	1
Our goal for today	1
Madison	1
Five times three	1
Can one go into eight	1
Any questions so far in this one	1
I will present the problem in this way okay	1
Do we have to cut them like that	1
Miss Landon do you have the first one done one and a half miles	1
You ready to break down fivesixths	1
Zoe	1
Youve finished that whole page	1
Well	1
So use it to answer the questions and just write the answers okay	1
Remy Julia Are you with me	1
Yeah	1
Elaine	1
It isnt okay if you try to solve it yourself and find it can be solved right	1
You and your partner discuss this when youve got the answer sit down	1
Eric what are you doing bud	1
All right Wayne do you want to continue this one or call on someone else	1
Classy classy	1
We could do 12 and one do you think that ones going to work	1
Yes maam	1
Theres two answers	1
How come	1
And then 2 goes into 8 four times right	1
Everybody got their model	1
Yes okay	1
Oh si	1
See	1
Did you say four eighths	1
Once you are done I will give you the go ahead to chart it okay	1
When you are asked to round is it easy to multiply 13 times 185	1
Turn and talk to your neighbor	1
Ally	1
Does that make sense crew	1
Ive turned it into a ray now havent I	1
So my five friends that are done could you please come and stand right here so I can hear what youve done	1
Are you going to draw a rectangle 450 feet with an area or 9 feet long	1
This person every single one of these	1
Dallas	1
If Im looking for a folder art youve got folder art	1
5 x 5 you used that fact that that was too much so you had to take one group away	1
Yeah if you do switch	1
Do you have to	1
Ive already done by tens times my tens right	1
One but not any others	1
Are there any domain restrictions on sine of X	1
Two right	1
Would it be impossible on the next draw	1
You think this ones easier to see	1
John	1
You are doing it the way Eriks talking about it you would   put one third over that area and you would put two thirds in   that area and three thirds in that area because this would be  representing one third   both of those would be two thirds and   three of those would be three thirds	1
Is that a lot to do for a general rule	1
I feel 100 confidence that everybody got it okay	1
Please stand	1
What did he say Asher	1
Who is talking to you about volume	1
Alicia	1
Okay so we now know that if we have I have to work this out with you so if I automatically know I have 225 left and then I multiply that is it going to be 425	1
Did you show us what the answer was	1
One two three show me your boards	1
Go ahead	1
I think 10 is zero or 10 is always that right	1
Cause  they re the same because the thirds are always bigger than  the half	1
Do we roll it we roll until each  three	1
Does that make sense	1
You said it would go 1 and 4	1
It doesnt	1
As soon as we say I cant we wont right	1
Does anybody have any questions	1
You see the difference there	1
Talk to your table	1
Yes	1
Can you break that down even further now	1
Where are you guys today	1
Questions on that one	1
G and H you dont have one yet	1
Yes	1
Carrie	1
So if you have a triangle with three sides okay and maybe lets change it To make this a little bit more lopsided okay	1
Okay so this is what I heard Yes	1
Did you think that	1
Weve seen a couple of different examples havent we	1
Victoria	1
Im sorry what	1
Have you ever thought about adding all three together	1
Yep	1
Look at the figure and set up an equation and work it out okay	1
Ty can you read it	1
Did you guys have it	1
Cameron	1
You said that this was the inequality equation right	1
Claire	1
Any questions about either one of those	1
So rate yourself	1
no	1
Am I starting to see the shape of the quadratic	1
The line has to be part of that	1
Are you ready for this craziness	1
Yeah whos class is that on the corner	1
Okay so I have eight five and five right	1
Show me in your fingers	1
Two halves right	1
You see how youve applied a rule	1
A half	1
Um so Lizzie can you repeat what you just said	1
Do you have that written down Missy	1
Yes	1
Are you sure	1
Stand up when you think you know	1
Is 16	1
I still dont know how it works	1
Total three	1
Bruce	1
2 times	1
Any other discussion	1
Go	1
You all understand what hes talking about	1
I just got one thing	1
Yes	1
Multiplication is a lot like addition right	1
Miles	1
Have you found the longest straw	1
And it does lie outside the original polygon does it	1
It s easy to imagine you could divide it into zillionths	1
And if youre stuck on if its a function or not take a look at the x values or draw in a vertical line or imagine drawing in a vertical line and seeing you can even like hold your hand up to graph and see does it cross at any Does it cross that more than one point	1
Yeah	1
Raise your hand if this is what you got	1
Miss	1
Ariel thinks that the rule is any number that I put here  under this column  is  that right	1
Does that make any sense Brian	1
Three	1
Who just said that	1
Lydia	1
Jerome	1
An inequality equation	1
Are we sure that it s right now	1
You did a math warmup for me didnt you Mental Math	1
Okay last but certainly not least Franc	1
Are you ready for	1
Continue though	1
Anybody	1
Twenty	1
So youre following along youre writing down what Im writing down okay	1
Okay so then go backwards so that youre the last one remember	1
Michael	1
I think Michael was first so we will let him go first	1
In reality 2300 yen is required right	1
Before we end for today	1
Are all eyes up on the board	1
Are you done	1
If we count by twos count by twos with me	1
Sophie	1
Carrie	1
How many of you are absolutely certain convinced nobody  can persuade you otherwise	1
Laura	1
Were you able to use the charts and look at the number sentence and the visual models and connect them	1
Wait this one read it like that	1
Done	1
I want you to write down an expression to model the problem that Im asking you okay	1
Are we ready	1
One share	1
No seven is two	1
I think Laurel might be able to help	1
Okay there any questions so far with these steps	1
Does that line connect at a 90 degree angle	1
Casey	1
And so you would give  this the name 112	1
There s a lot of space up there right	1
I really think he just needed to add more explaining and how he thought to that point and what is it	1
Are there any questions	1
Yes	1
Tyler	1
Are you ready	1
How many of you this is the combination in the bag	1
Over here	1
More ages	1
You have five numbers positive   zero one  two three and four	1
Would you share a pizza	1
Label the same	1
You counted by 5	1
How you feel about comparing fractions	1
Uh Mung Wing Chi	1
Is it going to be three	1
The length of the red right	1
So is that a factor prayer for five	1
This is usually a tenth   and then you put this  up and you call this two tenth  and then you take this and you put it  up to them   and it s  five they equal up to it	1
Lydia	1
Youre ready	1
You know how I feel about being able to describe what you did though right	1
Do you know where you would place a million	1
That makes sense	1
Go ahead	1
Yeah because all I did was a fact family right	1
So if I look at that I know that because we started with the tenths my outcome has to be a difference okay	1
But are they the same exact thing	1
You understand more	1
Remember we talked about a train	1
Okay are we good	1
22	1
Thats right huh	1
Jack did you hear what she said	1
Y axis at five y equals five	1
Look at all the hands Lilliana	1
So upwards is always positive yes	1
all we have to do is reduce the angles by one right	1
Show me on your fingers how much more time you need	1
Go for it please	1
Go ahead	1
Go	1
Whats nine times two	1
No	1
Yeah because well I m not sure	1
Charlotte ask your question	1
Can I	1
Yes Rose	1
Four halfs	1
Whos going to get the fancy pen	1
Any connection	1
While actually putting these in okay	1
Jeff and I thought that	1
Anna could you read to us please	1
But are they the same thing	1
And then for this case it is correct okay	1
Okay	1
Did we do the last one	1
Do we feel like we need more practice	1
Is that right	1
Are they	1
Thank you	1
Y	1
So if you think about it as a division problem you all know that 21 divided by five five goes into 21 four times right	1
Then these are parallel right	1
Four quarts okay	1
Does this work	1
I mean  I mean the rectangle	1
How quickly you forget the lessons from just yesterday	1
Well no cause its all about the exterior angles isnt it	1
You know what	1
So you re saying this seven here is that correct	1
Third	1
Those of you who built three models do you  think thats all	1
divided by 10	1
I could if I wanted to get everything to the lefthand side and set it  0 right	1
Is one fifth equal to two tenths	1
Thats a good sentence or what you saying	1
Bella	1
Are you not sure now	1
Because thats not an order	1
Ms  can I go to the bathroom	1
You just know that when you draw it thats how you have to draw it okay	1
It can be solved	1
Yes	1
You just thought of it	1
How many pieces we need	1
No problems right	1
No	1
Horizontally it moves away so I thought if move it away	1
Just depends what youre talking about right	1
Does that make sense	1
Julie	1
Did I do 7 times 6 over here	1
Judith	1
Caleb	1
When youve completed all of those stand up	1
How come its going down guys	1
Landon can you please turn your microphone on	1
Okay thoughts questions	1
Yes	1
We thought it was 8822	1
This is a one but my question  is is that a two	1
James	1
I dont have an answer right	1
I wonder if the rest of you see this Im saying this is an orange  and its not a purple its an orange and a red right	1
Bom bom	1
Annabelle	1
To you	1
Okay yes Maam	1
You with me	1
No	1
Marcus	1
Yes	1
Do you understand	1
Did my hands get further apart	1
Any other questions	1
How many of you had to do a couple of steps to even attempt to solve these problems	1
Substitute a 10 in for M Reed	1
Is there something in your fractions that we could match up to make one third	1
No	1
Okay so you think this one is a little harder to interpret	1
Two identical gifts okay	1
The answer is yes always because the divisor tells us either how many groups were going to have or how many per group we have right	1
What are the chances the World Series will be won in four games five games six games and seven games	1
Okay go ahead	1
Anna	1
If you think you  know please raise your hand	1
That sound good everybody	1
90 hundredths	1
Okay so Dianat you say that Prime So by looking at my prime numbers on the board of five and 11 you said they only have one factor	1
Thumb up if you have something on your paper for number one	1
Are you ready	1
And you got two thirds to be bigger  than one half	1
You said less than five	1
Cant it be solved	1
David	1
Go	1
Water	1
Four and six hundredths right	1
Do you want to do them all at once	1
Three times two	1
Logan do you want to come up and bring your pen	1
Try and talk to your groups	1
Can you guys both come up	1
Sandra	1
I wrote mine	1
So are you guys talking about what your answer should be	1
Can you try it both ways	1
We still have an array we just took part of it away right	1
You would change the three	1
So Id like you to look at your diagram here and just think to yourself for 10 seconds 20 seconds is this the correct line of reflection	1
Show your work to	1
Read the other one	1
Alexander do mopeds cost money	1
For our line segments we put points on the ends for our starting and our stopping point but does a line have points	1
Four people	1
Do you have a guess or do you have a comment or a question you want to ask us	1
Yes that is 40 Dan	1
Did you hear somebody say that	1
Is it going to be our best way to solve	1
Yall see that	1
Are you   all thinking of your numbers	1
Table group two	1
Because you used six pieces to fill up the hexagon and one of them equals 16	1
When you dont have to  and now that we have those	1
Mmhmm	1
There you go so Im going to fold it in a half right	1
Yes	1
9 boxes	1
Lena your turn	1
Edgar do you agree disagree or have a question about that one	1
I disagree with that because thats kind of a subtraction problem	1
Can we hear from someone else	1
Did you solve the wrong one	1
Create what theyre thinking a little bit	1
Does five work for the second problem	1
Zach go ahead honey	1
Are you guys with me	1
It kind of works but see if we just had this and try to make a circle out of that it doesnt totally work does it	1
Lots of steps	1
There we  go	1
Classity class	1
Does that one work	1
Not bad huh	1
Was this problem with your calculator	1
Meredith	1
Yes	1
Yes	1
I think it is negative one back there because it is beyond zero	1
So Adeline if I put that problem on the board could you solve it	1
From from this one tower	1
One and two thirds right	1
Is this group ready to move on	1
Is this okay for the first one	1
So Landon	1
Whos finished	1
You get the picture	1
Josh	1
This is strictly just writing okay	1
Threefourths	1
You did fraction	1
Does that work for everyone	1
Lucille asked if we subtracted these two would you get back to the original	1
To the nearest hundredth yes	1
You set up an inequality equation	1
Is it right now	1
So I have 1410 minus 1095 right	1
David	1
So he obtained it by noticing this okay	1
Okay Im going to give you some other options could you measure the volume of the gingerbread house with mini marshmallows	1
You all were making a few models and I know I  know Erik was making a model and hes worried about how  he can get it one his paper right	1
Theres Already a one there	1
She saw these groups right here and shes like well if I put these together and kind of flip this one around and match them Is that right Jason	1
Feeling Okay	1
Caleb	1
You could see its in another column that you could use not just the 40	1
You with me	1
Did you hear that	1
Did you read the problem though	1
but you cant put Audras fish into Danielles box because its too small	1
They look pink here  though right	1
Carson you were actually my next person	1
Oh my God what a surprise	1
Do you remember that	1
Did anybody get it wrong	1
You guys good	1
Because	1
So would that be a polygon	1
Because do those two still have anything in common	1
come on up	1
Because that s be um the dark green	1
Yeah one minus nineteen is negative eighteen right	1
Has everybody seen what he did	1
No its four it s four six eight ten  and then there was  that odd and then there was that two thirds one	1
Pinko	1
Charlotte	1
Classity class	1
Because when youre doing times 15 youre doing 15 3 to get 3 but over there	1
Youre ready	1
Karina	1
Or ask a question	1
No	1
Now can you put numbers inside	1
Is it that you don t see that it s two  fourths	1
But you cant  decide can you	1
I think you only because if you do 3 times 5 is 15 and 3 times 2 is six and yet three times	1
Who did me	1
Chloe	1
How much of the sandwich is left for Joe	1
Maybe its 40 times two	1
Ok so Sarah  and Beth you built one you dont have enough	1
You think you got it	1
Table two	1
Say the first one again	1
Huh	1
Huh	1
Would the outnumber be the same for both tables	1
Katia	1
Rick	1
100	1
Pay attention okay	1
It seems to be sma smaller huh	1
Martha	1
Its faster than counting right	1
Yeah thats what I mean	1
Please show me with your fingers how long you need	1
We met this one yesterday right	1
Let s see are there twelve of them there	1
Yes	1
Threethirds is equal to one right	1
Did you mean 30 Hundredths	1
Is there anybody who would like to  tell me what they think about this	1
Does everybody agree with me	1
Make sense	1
Did you hear what Alan said	1
So for every five green there are five blue right	1
Go	1
Does anybody do a rectangle to show that connection	1
Melanie you had a comment about the previous question	1
If Im taking five and Im multiplying it by half right	1
Two times nine	1
Did you say be	1
Doesnt it seem somewhat that they are the same huh	1
Xaxis	1
Does that make sense	1
In one table there could be two different conversations happening right Wayne	1
Okay now can you find the slope and the y intercept from the picture	1
Colored pencil okay	1
128	1
You want to do the negative	1
See from this towers right	1
Six twelfths	1
How do what	1
Okay any questions on this one	1
All right any questions so far	1
Domain is legal x s right	1
Yeah go ahead	1
How about size are they the same size	1
Raise your hand if you feel comfortable sharing your answer	1
Helena	1
Were trying to figure out what our portions is	1
Teresa	1
Lastly what is it parallelogram	1
Did you get it	1
Maybe	1
Hm	1
Its thirty point one	1
And is it okay to  do it this time	1
Nate	1
What is that	1
Did you get two and seventwelfths	1
Then Genji	1
Thats sharp huh	1
Does that make sense	1
Here	1
Alaina	1
If you calculate that it becomes X to the second power again	1
Zero	1
Yeah	1
FALSE	1
You were saying Andrew	1
Is that what youre saying	1
So in this  case if if your one is going to be the size of this little stage if  you like  your players are made the boy  the girl the fish the boat in relationship to this stage isnt it	1
Okay table two every time x goes up by one is y going up or down by the same amount	1
Can anybody restate what she just said	1
I could multiply it	1
The rule is double each number of the original pair	1
Okay twice as long	1
Yes	1
Actually we didnt	1
Were going to look at the next problem because this is where Im going to know if you understand why this works okay	1
Well wouldnt that just be one two three four five six seven eight nine	1
Any questions about math	1
Cooper	1
Plus	1
Camille	1
When you drew your box so if your box The first thing I needed to do was break it into thirds right	1
Because we multiplied the first number by two and thats the xaxis	1
Can I ask you a question now	1
Meredith	1
Oh it was said already	1
Remember how thats when you pick a letter for the unknown	1
Can you separate those two on top a little bit because they re a  different color and they look like does that help Andrew	1
We know 365 times 10 is   right	1
That is also their thing right	1
Yes	1
Gavin	1
Does that have anything to do with how many slices I ate	1
I know its a mixed symbol	1
If you say that	1
So we think about the average age of a human right	1
Its just repeated addition right	1
Noah	1
And the fifth game player B won ten to six	1
In between these two purple segments angle B okay	1
Yes	1
They arent parallel right	1
Yeah	1
Well one could also just calculate without the bracket	1
Lyles walking rate does that equation look like one that weve been working on in here	1
Would you make this the base	1
You are estimating okay	1
If you write nothing in between there then you mean times right	1
Which one	1
Purple	1
See your multiplication symbol in the middle	1
Classity class	1
So number them in other words okay	1
This one should say Are you all getting this one	1
If I  called my candy bar dark brown right instead of yellow and  green it s the same size isn t it	1
Mmm over each of  em	1
Okay now it s listening time  because how many have one model	1
The quiz for today or the quiz for tomorrow is on pages one through 10 right	1
Ms Ms Cornish I have a question	1
triangle	1
Can we factor this out	1
David	1
Right to make a table for the equation right	1
So the number on the bottom is your whole and the number on top is your parts okay	1
Ill give you here know what	1
You have 230yen cakes and 200yen cakes right	1
The dots are the groups you times your groups	1
What was your question	1
We got it because the 12 could be divided perfectly into it here right	1
You wouldnt write it like that would you	1
Katalina	1
All 11	1
T	1
Zach I am going to are you good	1
So if I think about picking out fives I can pick out like this right	1
Erica	1
Twenty times 20 equals 20 squared	1
Sit down when youre done	1
Do you have a question	1
Count how much wholes you have	1
expert	1
Okay so you need to make sure your explanation goes with the words that youre using okay	1
Finley	1
Yeah	1
What are you confused about	1
Its going to move	1
Memorizing right	1
is right there is on the line	1
Gold ribbon	1
Wait I have a question	1
Dont they	1
And you said youre saying that you each got eight	1
Maya go ahead	1
Do you all know what I am saying	1
Not much better but a little bit right	1
How many of you think that that is true	1
Yes	1
Dan	1
Six yards of string	1
And they re not that commonly rolled	1
No	1
This is what were looking for right	1
Fourfifths	1
When you minus this one from this one you get the multiplying number	1
Like this	1
You think itll be twenty one	1
Oh	1
How does that sound	1
A denominator	1
Is the answer 7 and 56	1
Our second problem Yeah	1
So 15	1
So we have one half two fourths three sixths right	1
Did we double	1
Open every fourth locker	1
Any more questions	1
Norah	1
This one were just comparing Oh did I goof it up	1
What do you guys think	1
Money right	1
I am sorry did you understand four hundred	1
Two	1
Is this fraction circle sliced up at all	1
Two halves	1
Meanwhile how far did you get	1
And one sixth would be this right	1
Haley does that make more sense	1
Pick me	1
Six times three cubed minus four times three cubed	1
You have to add the length of all the sides	1
Two eighths	1
Yeah	1
Easy right	1
Is this a straight line	1
Understand	1
Its okay right	1
6 right	1
Yeah	1
Everybody	1
What What should we start with our first one	1
Now can I take one from nine	1
Second	1
Did you do times five	1
Yes	1
Yes okay	1
Are we done	1
Say it extrapolate	1
Because without an answer its not wholly complete	1
Miguel	1
Shane try to improve your presentation a little will you	1
Sandra please	1
Do you need me Robert	1
The area	1
Want to talk for a while and Ill join you in a couple of minutes	1
I want you to say that mixed number	1
Yes maam	1
6 for a half of 12	1
Threeninths	1
5x13	1
Could  you see in your heads the three with one red	1
Five plus two is seven seven times three is twentyone	1
We spread them out	1
Weve used it under the term decimal point right	1
If you think Hadley is going to win you will copy what Hadley has okay	1
So fractions can equal a whole	1
Drew	1
Exponential notation	1
Julia	1
Any other questions on here	1
I wrote that so you dont have to	1
Im going to read the whole problem and were not going to do anything until Im done okay	1
Has anybody ever heard of an earthworm	1
Okay thats not the objective though that were looking for is it	1
Classity class	1
How are you feeling about being able to compare ratios using ratio language or quantities using ratio language	1
If I dont know how to do 7 times 50 can I do 7 times 5	1
What are you adding on from here to here and here to here  when this is no reds right	1
Do I have a six	1
Wait passed through it on the ground or in the air	1
Fourteen right	1
What	1
And thats okay because it was a little quiet please repeat what you said	1
Not really because two of the cards are the same right	1
Can you stand up and show everybody so they can all see your paper	1
410	1
Raise your hand if you  yes two rectangles you could keep your hands raised	1
Tell me if this works	1
Did you compare them	1
Because	1
Two times two	1
A trapezoid because one whole equals threethirds right	1
Did you erase that line	1
Is it okay	1
Is that five tenths	1
Does that make sense	1
Those of you in MathLand are you clear whats happening	1
Natalie	1
Whats a diagram again	1
Six times five	1
Did she say she wants to double it	1
You said sixty and then you added eight	1
Expanded form okay	1
Now we could do 13 times three right	1
What about this	1
Now Im wondering some  of you looked at me sort of ahha I see what shes doing right	1
Well youre saying if you took a twelfth a rod that has length one  twelfth and another rod that has length one twelfth and put them  together right	1
Yes Alan	1
Even though I have all these Christmas gifts to pay for did I still have to pay rent this month	1
Yes	1
Those six coins get split between two pouches so then you divide it by two at the end right	1
Ha yeah Aurore	1
You think its going to be less	1
How to do number 20	1
Does that make that anything bad at the beginning	1
Vance	1
You multiplied three times two	1
Ah the orange and red	1
And then you multiplied the whole thing by two cause you knew there were two groups of that right	1
You answered that so then what you would say on the back when it asks you Was your rule correct	1
Good job which one	1
Have you checked it	1
How about you did you finish them all	1
Sarah	1
Anybody else	1
Everybody needs to get something wrong	1
Done	1
Thatd be like taking it away right	1
Can we change the  color names of white and the train with red  and orange to number names at this point  now	1
Raise your hand if you remembered that step	1
Okay then continuing um Fujita	1
Lets start with you	1
Length times we could do  length times width times height	1
Would we have any babies	1
But this time Everly you paying attention	1
Say eighteen	1
Where you at expert understand most of it understand some of it or dont understand	1
Honour	1
Any questions on any of those five reminders or announcements so far	1
Oh youve got those	1
They went up by	1
Raise your hand	1
Diana	1
Any questions about how we can go from y intercept and slope just right to the equation	1
Any questions	1
I dont think so	1
Because theyre basically the same number we just did a different order	1
I think Seths better because his range is the smallest so his times are very consistent	1
Did you  check in with your neighbor	1
Is that the only food would divide	1
Partner B share your thinking	1
How many of you think the answer is equal to	1
Does that make sense	1
You found it did you	1
To the right	1
Who noticed that	1
For this problem	1
So were thinking is it closer to three and 61 hundreds are we going to keep it	1
What is it that isnt clear	1
For example this is one correct	1
Anybody else get that too	1
So four times 12 is going to tell us how many eggs in a month right	1
Okay so have you been using the the fraction circle pieces	1
Got a few right	1
I have another way	1
See what I mean	1
Audra	1
Once you know it give me a thumbs up	1
You already finished this	1
Dont forget though get some IXL action going on today at some point okay	1
Yeah	1
No	1
So it doesnt work does it	1
Does my answer make sense	1
Same right	1
What does  that say Michael	1
Right	1
5 regardless starts at 5 and then is sponsor B getting anything every kilometer	1
You and your partner are going to create number stories okay	1
Youre with me	1
OK anyone else	1
What was my	1
What	1
No	1
Are you here too Hudson	1
Harrison	1
Well later on if you want to but let s say it to the camera right now	1
And then you guys are going to get to do a couple in some groups today okay	1
Because of the way this worked this doesnt always happen but with this set of data the mean the median and the mode were all 50 right	1
Is this it	1
It was like there was a hidden piece	1
Keep going	1
Because I have one third two thirds right	1
So you colored in the third one now	1
Can you answer and prove	1
Uh Isnt that uh	1
Can we give him two claps for that	1
rectangle	1
You want to add some six	1
Thumb up if youre done	1
How are you gentlemen doing did you get another new model	1
They did	1
By getting a smaller by cutting it into by cutting it into more than three pieces but less than 36	1
Lizzie whats up	1
Okay you think its two	1
Easy	1
Let s hear from Ankur then we ll have Milin and um Michelle s yeah	1
That sound good everybody	1
Elaina	1
Carrie	1
Andrew	1
So two sixths plus 12345 6 12ths would be a sum I could use right	1
Is that line of reflection	1
You can see a meter	1
Its pretty much an InNOut box right	1
Does everybody understand that	1
Ariana	1
They are	1
Patrick please read it out loud	1
Its closer to two	1
Are you actually wearing a microphone	1
Huh	1
Its wonderful huh	1
Easy	1
Adam what happened to one in 412 and one and 1112th	1
Yes	1
You want to tell us	1
Do you want to go over that one of 12 and 8	1
Ms Sadie stand up please	1
Annabel can you reiterate it	1
48	1
Make sense	1
Now Im looking over and what are you doing	1
Does it	1
Can she do it	1
Yes	1
Five	1
Conversion	1
Martina	1
Any questions about last nights homework	1
Um it would be so the answer	1
Factor times a factor equals a product right	1
Is it one twelfth	1
Up this one	1
Is this any different than this	1
Good but can you do it without multiplying by four and two	1
Yes Daniel	1
Huh	1
Wider by two times	1
Now the highest we can do is 1900  1000	1
She is like Okay six is in the tenth place right	1
You could fit one fraction into the other couldnt you	1
Id rather save things okay	1
Thats what our teacher did	1
Now someone who was not in my group because I know that my group talks about this	1
So while I dont have a hundred here can we visualize how small the pieces are	1
I am not sure if it will because of these two pieces	1
Youll notice it right	1
Because remember my zeros rule	1
Make sense now	1
Two	1
Theres a room filled with  Did you say tires	1
And so it would be really nice if we knew that this side was congruent to this side right	1
How are we feeling	1
Can I subtract	1
A rhombus	1
Now have you found the straw and have you measured it	1
I got the donate in there	1
Are there any questions so far	1
Its only a third of a pizza	1
Okay easy enough right	1
You solved it	1
Anybody	1
Good	1
Chloe	1
I think an equivalent fraction is like a you can make one fraction and make it different numbers	1
So you found that when we are multiplying the same base did you notice that the base had to be the same	1
Oh so 18	1
But one thing that  would be the same is the relative one thing you have to be  careful each of you in your own models would be the sizes in  relation to the other sizes right	1
this one becomes four thirds as well but theyre not all three the same right	1
Is that true Michelle	1
Go	1
Could you have done the graphs and then answered Part A	1
Are you done	1
Yes Corrine	1
You are filling these out the same way I am okay	1
No because for number three	1
When you find another pair I want you to put one finger up in the air	1
Do you understand how he did that	1
So if you have for example a really large number for instance uh well yes I dont know uh for example with five numbers	1
Ilea	1
Jaxon	1
Thats all you did	1
So if we are finding one Go ahead Charlie	1
Twos and fours you are the writer for number one okay	1
Just stretching	1
Wyatt	1
Anybody got any others	1
Did I do 7 times 6	1
You don t know mine	1
Ok so does that mean we have a different answer	1
That way I can see better	1
Ill show you one more example Hugh and then well practice with them okay	1
Do you guys see that	1
Lincoln	1
Whats up	1
Turn and talk to your partner	1
These sides are congruent this would be point D Everybody agree so far	1
I said there will be 15 baskets	1
Ten	1
Micah lets do it	1
Was that important	1
Discuss it with your partner	1
Jackie	1
This you could	1
Share with a neighbor	1
Mason	1
If we wanted to we could double it again okay	1
Exactly	1
You agreed	1
Is  so far done	1
No	1
Before we do that lets go ahead and add our whole numbers okay	1
Excuse me	1
Yes Zoey sorry for interrupting you keep going	1
Ms Tolliver Raise your hand if you can revise your thinking a little bit	1
Four	1
When youre baking	1
That was why it was so difficult understanding that process okay	1
Yes	1
Depends  Because its an odd number the three is you have to go all the way back to another number that would get it remotely close to three fourths which in my opinion would be	1
Baking	1
Do you want to come draw	1
What you said is when were estimating we look to see if its closer to three fourths is it closer to one half is it closer to a whole is it closer to a half	1
She said one is sectioned and has words down here like basketball gymnastics right	1
But here you can directly	1
Do you remember what it was	1
Its a diagonal square right	1
Do you remember doing that	1
Okay so you really think that sixteen is right	1
Sixty	1
Can we put another on every single tray	1
The total was 1000 yen wasnt it	1
Onetwo	1
X Y easy right	1
Dont forget to ask yourself that question Does my answer make sense	1
You should see the outline on the book of the sailboat	1
45 fifths	1
So then this would be one  and this would be one	1
Are these models I guess this is my question to you  are they really different	1
Times five	1
Mia come on up	1
Is this your sailboat	1
Do Sarahs ordered pairs model the data	1
Anybody want to do it	1
Yes maam	1
Whos going to try it	1
Square	1
Okay are you guys with me	1
So it has to be flipped for that one because of what column its under right	1
Okay purple it is	1
So thats the area	1
Seven times five	1
You knew that what they needed to split it into was when it says how many pieces should he cut the bar	1
Eight hundred	1
Erik	1
Please Kameron	1
Okay you multiply it	1
I needed groceries right	1
Or to 9	1
I stopped working on that because I didn t read it right	1
We also have to We have to convert the one half into sixths right	1
What do you think Jessica and Laura	1
What do you think	1
Ok  Alright if you had to say where the twentyseven came  from do you remember	1
We re done with it	1
Okay go ahead	1
One	1
SS right tell somebody next to you	1
Yes	1
All right you ready	1
Sort of a little dishonest is she	1
I wont do it	1
Mr Jack do you understand where 24 is coming from	1
Ask the question	1
How many of you  can imagine a third	1
But youre not going to draw the same triangle are you	1
Yeah kind of	1
Please go ahead then	1
Mmhmm	1
So can that really be five halves	1
Vertical	1
Could you please do that again	1
Go ahead	1
Once again I have to make sure that that is aligned right	1
Now negative fivethirds would mean you come down five and you go over three right	1
Ueda how far did you go	1
Show me on your fingers how many more minutes you think you might need to get all six warmup questions done	1
I would say I know one bigger just add one to it right	1
And	1
Yeah can you	1
Jack what did I just say	1
You ready	1
Brian	1
Then you did 10two right	1
Oh can I place Dans yet	1
Alright so then this is the third of a meter this is a third  between these two	1
Would that work	1
Okay dont forget if youve got that situation where something is all cubed both the numerical coefficient as well as the variable has to be cubed yeah	1
This is the one working for this one	1
Its not	1
Arogia do you	1
Thats an interesting idea ok maybe thats I hadnt  thought about it that way Erik but lets suppose were  making identical kinds of bows were making can we  talk about a standard bow in here	1
What Im asking	1
Were going to take the red shape  you with me	1
Did you do your rubric and circle what you think you should put on it	1
Do you have to write what what	1
Any questions so far	1
Austin youve got that Am I correct	1
All right read this next problem	1
How many of you think  you know the answer to that	1
Madeline	1
Doing them backwards isnt as bad as not doing them at all right	1
Origin	1
Or you could do side by side but it looks like that right	1
Finely	1
Youd have bigger people bigger boat and a bigger fish	1
Does everybody agree this angle is the same as this one	1
Does onehalf plus onehalf equal one whole hexagon	1
Yes	1
Bruno	1
Whats that	1
Xavier	1
Did you think that	1
Could we say its right	1
So are you looking at these numbers these numbers	1
Okay and Valentina H	1
You guys	1
What do we think about that	1
All right you want to try something else	1
Stand when you think youve got it	1
Meet	1
I made the sea  monster bigger than the boat	1
How many of you are sure we can make another  model	1
Cooper what do you think	1
Is that  what you were thinking I did Meredith	1
No	1
We did the three three times and we added it up to nine	1
Yeah	1
Does that ever happen to you	1
Its telling you what is it closer to	1
Arnold	1
Dont tell me tell them	1
Okay let me see real quick by show of hands how many of you are completely lost and dont understand what to do	1
Its a quadrilateral right	1
But I guess Im asking the question uh to Meredith and  James and to Erik and Alan right now uh does this have  anything to do with your theory and the theory you tested	1
I know	1
Why this 5 works	1
Are they related	1
Did you find that using addition helped you solve the problem	1
Will that work	1
Okay any questions on this first one	1
Sonia	1
Who hasn t had a chance to draw from the bag	1
Andrew	1
Can you guys look at me for a moment	1
Okay Arthur	1
How come one never works except for the time we all think of one	1
Erin	1
Same thing isnt it	1
Some random guy came and stole her pizza	1
I am	1
Were not uh exactly sure whats being asked here	1
Okay Hadley can you say that in your own words	1
George	1
Did the mode double	1
It s three  pieces right	1
I think I can finish it	1
Three times	1
Over a hundred years	1
SS right has your pencil transformed	1
The one on the right seems like mean and mode and whatnot	1
Because only one part of the coordinates is being multiplied its not going to maybe retain this in shape but look a little more different	1
I have 10 and 1015 yes	1
Yeah mmm hmm	1
Ashlyn	1
Do the color names change	1
Ready	1
Anna	1
Is it really a quarter of a meter when it s folded	1
Itll be easier wont it	1
So its basically doubled each of the length is doubled	1
Do you think that every year people eat 2000 pounds of food per year	1
Who was it	1
You are telling me that would be one and three fourths	1
Uh is it done by you	1
So you say the ratio of East fans to West fans is 23 all right	1
I will have a look at those tomorrow yes	1
Don t we	1
What followup questions do you have Giana	1
I want to hear from Jared	1
To the left So somewhere like this maybe	1
It is like a ruler here it has the inches one half one and one half two and one  half three and one half four and one half five and one half and so on	1
Oh	1
Like what I said kind of	1
E	1
So you ready for the next problem	1
And so you will get this equation okay	1
Okay any questions about that one	1
Okay so now we have our different amounts and so now were going to add all these together okay	1
Yes	1
How about this	1
Wayne are you partnering	1
Agree	1
Mos have you finished most of it	1
Thumbs  up	1
Partner B your turn	1
We dont understand how youre supposed to find the median	1
Should we stand up when were done	1
I just see how how how do you have to do that	1
Did you wonder what you would do if uh they werent equally matched	1
Andrea	1
All right are you guys ready for another challenge	1
And by showing her that do you understand  why you did it wrong	1
Pleun tell me tell me tell me	1
We could add one or we could multiply it by two if we multiply by two are we going to get two	1
James	1
How many	1
And youd end up with four and 2 tenths right	1
Yes	1
Isnt it like that	1
How many of you guys want my help	1
It would be more than one right	1
Oh I see	1
You did very good	1
David	1
Carson	1
Let me call on uh Mark	1
There probably isnt anyone right	1
to five how are you feeling	1
Yes Melanie	1
Did you hear it last year	1
Holden	1
And now we have the right answer right	1
So you will realize the reason why when we are looking for the bigger number A is the bigger number right	1
Right	1
David	1
Jeremy	1
Yeah	1
I m sorry Meredith could you start again	1
Ankur	1
So	1
So to compared to three is that the same proportion as four over six	1
Devon	1
Gabby did you hear that	1
Twentyone	1
And then you get three times two equals six	1
I think that its five too	1
Hunter	1
How many  of you think you know how much bigger it is	1
Show with your fingers from a one to four how you feel about finding the missing sides of rectangles when given the area	1
And if you take one of them  it s equal to two tenths	1
Three	1
Okay	1
Group fives	1
Is it a complete sentence	1
You know what	1
So if the question is is it a linear function	1
F Okay	1
Then cant you get one on this side	1
Do you know how to do that	1
Brian	1
That is okay	1
Were just going here right	1
Does it work for 4	1
Nice and loud Erik	1
Eight	1
Okay talk to your table about it	1
Yeah	1
Can you hear me now	1
So are you ready	1
Does that mean the same thing	1
How many of you think the answer is less than	1
Still how do I get it	1
Is there a constant multiplier between these	1
Brady and Georgia please stand	1
Do we have a rule	1
Alexis	1
Yes	1
Do you have it	1
Does that match	1
Yes Caroline	1
Is this side the same for both of them	1
But are they equivalent to each other	1
So youre gonna multiply your exponents right	1
Question	1
Does everybody see how theres a little square missing right here	1
Do I need to write the zero	1
No	1
Chance you can answer this question	1
Three	1
You guys have a little conversation check each other and make sure youre all on the same page	1
Next uhm using this as a foundation okay	1
Yes but	1
Karina	1
Andrew	1
Can I ask you another question	1
Are you ready to think	1
I thought the fifth was wrong when I did  it because everything was kinda moved back	1
You have the answer	1
Are we taking away when you divide	1
Those are this and this okay	1
I dont have enough of these blocks so I  said can you imagine it and I remember talking and I know Andrew  actually made the model when David had a theory that he shared  with um Erik and Alan and Meredith right David	1
Yes but are you doing anything to this one	1
Paul	1
Excellent and did you finish this part as well	1
Did they pay the same rate	1
Miriam	1
Im just doing it in fourths okay	1
Yeah Sawyer	1
In the brackets	1
How many of you did that  with one model and you are absolutely convinced with your model  you know which is bigger one half or two thirds	1
Five	1
Yeah	1
Okay	1
Okay everybodys done	1
Do I have a 60	1
If you round to the nearest 100 did you get 800	1
If we were to go over to our picture and we were to now make eight slices of pizza did I change how much I colored in	1
No it will be three times three right	1
Alex do you have a question	1
Can I fit six into six	1
Is it Etsumi	1
Yes Tim	1
Well not quite 3 feet is it	1
So Frankie	1
Yes Parker	1
Katie	1
Theyre all half	1
Did you also have a question	1
Thats right huh	1
Anyone	1
Do you understand why I asked if you needed to know exactly what 45 times nine was	1
Lisa would you like to read that	1
Well because there was a pattern	1
After applying rules the image you all know what an image is	1
You dont know	1
Iliana	1
Hunter	1
Is that right	1
What is that	1
The thing here	1
You see what you did wrong	1
Franc	1
Brandon	1
Whats up	1
Yes	1
Its what	1
Fraction	1
Kate what	1
Were some of us confused about that	1
Lets say this together	1
Turn and talk to your partner	1
Go ahead	1
Thats little I can barely see   is it Osi	1
No	1
Yes	1
Ahhh	1
Because its larger than the dividend and if you try and subtract it from your divided then its going to be a negative	1
One two three	1
So does that make it easier	1
I dont understand that one	1
Is that how you made your comparison	1
Its the same okay	1
Cyrus	1
Three	1
Well the people that got one fourth got more by fivethirtysixths	1
Eliza	1
How many people feel like their comfort zone their jam is really looking at those fraction circle pieces	1
Brendan	1
So thats going to say do we know how Shares line is	1
The easiest easiest one of all	1
Its almost there right	1
Do you see whats going on	1
You d all pick a half right	1
Bryan what did you have to say	1
Thumbs to the side if youre kind of in the middle	1
Mmmhmm	1
Anybody else	1
Remember how Audrey worded her rule	1
No	1
Eight	1
Because it says over there	1
Counterclockwise	1
Is there anyone who cant imagine that	1
So were going to look here You think youve done this one right	1
Yes	1
And so for point B right here you get a point right there B right	1
Does it make sense that one half is exactly between negative three and four	1
So yesterday we were talking area model right	1
How  many heard what Erik said	1
Does it make sense in any way	1
Is this easy to add	1
Class	1
Remember how we did it the other day when we looked at both the answers and we decided if it met what we wanted it to meet	1
Yeah I would probably pick the red because its all positive right	1
Jen	1
We go back to our	1
80 times	1
All right when you divide do you use partial quotients	1
Isnt that crazy	1
Yeah yeah	1
We have a rule	1
Its not really a lot different than what we did yesterday right	1
Right now I want you to share with your neighbor someone sitting right by you	1
Alley	1
Because	1
Reuben are you saying that it shows numbers in order	1
So for what number   for odd number   this is what you do right	1
Ariel the rule that you came up with was that you take that number divide by two is that right	1
Can you see that	1
Is it a straight line going up though	1
Nathan	1
Thats a fifth right	1
One two three show me your boards	1
Who have I not talked Xavier	1
How are you men over here	1
Did you follow the points on the chart	1
If you need to move my keyboard go ahead	1
This one here	1
So how do you feel like youre doing on this material from this week	1
Its bent right	1
You cant have anything without a starting point right	1
It looks like a third	1
Go ahead	1
Complex multidigit numbers	1
Thats seven	1
Does that work	1
Okay Ashank	1
Did you do this	1
Is it fraction of on the computer	1
Who would like to read this problem aloud	1
Question over here	1
I have it right here	1
Did you guys write something down for number one on journal page 178	1
So what are you going to feel	1
Diego says can we bust this up and make something equivalent to one half	1
Okay Miss Julia	1
Roge does that make sense	1
If area model has to be done first understand partial products to then understand US traditional thats what you use okay	1
Whichever way is easiest to do this does it come out to be the same every single time	1
Did I just prove to you which one is bigger	1
I just knew it wasn t fair	1
You just cant touch each others fraction pieces okay	1
Do you see what your explanation needs to be like	1
Yeah	1
Nelson	1
Might be misunderstanding that kind of stuff	1
Nice and loud Beth	1
Third	1
Adam	1
Start thinking can I do a multiplication problem can I do a division problem	1
Like 10 divided by 5	1
So when youre looking at IJ and HG or GH are those lines going to be parallel	1
Which part are you pointing at	1
Lets here from Jessica	1
So you need to break the fourth you need to break the two into one and five fourths right	1
Mr Finn you say yes to that question	1
Can you share	1
Is that right	1
Sounds good	1
And my guess was twelve hundred	1
Itll take a little bit longer to	1
Does that make sense	1
What	1
Are you guys starting to understand why I say how important it is for you to understand your multiplication facts	1
The increased amount right	1
No	1
Ohba how are you doing	1
Can you see that	1
And were still clueless	1
Asher you understand what you were doing	1
Have you hit a wall	1
Make sense	1
Two eighths	1
I have five people can repeat what Laurie literally just said which was the right answer	1
What would you like to tackle	1
Divide my hair down the middle	1
Did you understand what I am asking right	1
Does that make sense	1
Thats right huh	1
Go	1
Does that work	1
Celeste	1
Now how can I check this	1
Do you see just one of everything up here	1
Aiden if you dont understand what somebody is doing should you be asking them questions	1
I built it on my desk	1
When you find another pair I want you to put another finger up in the air and if you find a third pair I want you to put three fingers up	1
No	1
Ohhhh	1
11  00 AM 10  00 AM 900 AM right	1
Were looking at that equal part right	1
Can I ask you a question	1
What is the total area for the	1
Do you have any questions as were going through	1
Ava	1
And this would say that I was born in the year nine	1
All the way down	1
Stand up if you havent dont be embarrassed	1
Can you say that again	1
Andrea	1
James	1
Because I dont have anything all the way over to 15 do I	1
60	1
Did it tell you they have to be in order	1
Dado	1
Erik	1
Did you get that	1
What about you	1
Sixtwelfths	1
Totally 100	1
Abigail	1
The partial products	1
Royce youre working on that	1
You made revisions and I am going to look to see what good responses you have okay	1
Anybody else	1
Ms Strathom work his mic wasnt worth working on breakout room	1
A half	1
And punctuation do we have a form of punctuation	1
Everybody read that	1
Its improper	1
And then the  18	1
You can read it if you want	1
These two are probably going to be more easier	1
Isaac	1
What sweetie	1
is one and 75ths equal to four and two fifths	1
Did you guys keep going with Gerry	1
Thats what you were trying to figure out	1
These two fractions are equal right	1
Meredith what is your  comment	1
Anybody online have any questions	1
Do you remember	1
So you see that twofourths is equal to twofourths	1
Want to think about that	1
Some of you did it differently some of you said  three divided by a third is equal to three plus three plus  three or nine	1
So if you were at a supermarket	1
Yes	1
Do we do we need to solve these using a system of equations	1
I	1
So where didnt I go	1
Now in the way of review can  anybody tell me if I give this train the  number name 1	1
Well I thought because if you double the coordinates then I thought maybe it could be longer	1
Dan	1
Right whatever well figure it out right	1
Do you have to restrict yourself to dollars	1
If you look at how far spread out the data is is last years data way more spread out	1
Margo did you get a chance to get that done	1
Two twelfths  by one twelfth	1
Any questions so far	1
So three y minus x plus y minus x does is that what you said Rob	1
Teacher	1
Arden	1
Points right	1
Im curious	1
Uh factors multiples	1
Want to think about it	1
Is angle B larger than A	1
Yes	1
Please read this part for me	1
Um three	1
We estimate so when we do get our answer we can see if its really correct	1
Class	1
You will never multiply with just signs will you	1
Chiba	1
How  many have five models	1
You want to keep it there Meredith	1
if you use different models	1
Elliot	1
There should be one X	1
Andrew you want to  give it a try	1
Oh sorry	1
What	1
Two and one fourth See can I tell you guys something Im noticing	1
Oh wheres the confidence from my class	1
Yes	1
So I would have seven cubes in my hand right	1
Why don t you work with your partner and see if you can  figure it out	1
What do you guys think	1
Thats what its asking you to do okay	1
Are you going to solve that	1
This should be 13	1
Can I add those up	1
I got 18 times 5	1
23 of an apple is in the basket	1
Im not dividing anything Im only multiplying something right	1
Serenity	1
Who thinks it is not a complete sentence	1
No	1
divided by five	1
2x6	1
You hear now Mr Sean	1
Did you understand something about slope maybe a little bit better	1
Assistance okay	1
No	1
First have across right	1
No its the exact same isnt it	1
Kayla did you color in what I asked you to color in	1
Two	1
Two	1
Anybody else Have Any other questions	1
JulGabbya	1
Josh	1
Wayne	1
Now does it surprise you that player A won one time here	1
Are you just not sure	1
You get that X is equal to 102 is 102 85	1
No questions	1
So eight is a bigger denominator but that just means we cut the piece into more slices right	1
Christoph	1
So that would be you put the  minus that number times	1
Plus three C can you do anything with that	1
No	1
Could you read that first  problem for us again	1
It s just for number eight	1
Does that make better sense	1
Which one are you missing	1
Yes please	1
Well even in the short term right	1
Did anybody miss both people miss both	1
Greta	1
Its labeled with O that means origin right	1
Ok How many of you are sure we can  make another model	1
Squared	1
Nash	1
Franc instead of just sitting there what should you be doing	1
161	1
How about Tarin	1
Then its something you and I are going to talk about during the help session okay	1
Meredith	1
Say that one more time	1
When youve got an answer stand up	1
harder	1
X coordinate and Y coordinate	1
Does that work for 3	1
Did you want the sea monster to be bigger than the boat	1
She said something how it s legal for some stupid reason	1
Where are you four	1
X	1
Can you see Haley	1
Four times	1
So Dan read the next one	1
Are you done	1
Elaine	1
The things I do	1
This has become straight right	1
I cant hear you	1
Hey what are you confused about guys	1
Gavin what did I just say	1
Laura	1
We agree	1
Are we all right then	1
Can I try that one more time	1
Come on Lucas	1
33	1
Any questions about that	1
Again can you repeat the word form of this number	1
Did you change your mind	1
Okay so just like I have over here	1
That one was a little bit more tricky so you could use multiplication table	1
You  keep on doing that	1
That s what I heard you say Jeff	1
Three A twos	1
Say that one more time Romina	1
Instead of going to 640 he could have just gone to 610 and that would have been easier 610 instead of 640	1
Its like this or like this huh	1
No	1
It was oh I forget the name but  really recently its where you get the	1
Sir	1
We cant be mixing it up okay	1
When you do the arm length data make sure you put in the new data that we have with Maria and who else	1
Oh its 55	1
Lina go for it	1
Lets say that together	1
So here weve got Lilith is five and a half so Noah is one and a half right	1
Im gonna have him go first	1
Addison	1
So share your answers with your neighbors	1
The powers of okay	1
I do not think that the first expression is greater than 45 x 9 because in the parenthesis it has 45 x 9 and then it has  50 so I know its going to be less than 45 x 9	1
Where you at	1
Yes	1
You think the friend	1
Declan	1
Its this right	1
Eight	1
Ian	1
I ll do number seven	1
So your success criteria today Landon is	1
Just six and three	1
Checking everybody has it but you got it right	1
Wow you guys are doing good at this I wasnt sure if you guys would pick this up did you get it	1
Go Nessa	1
And when you got it raise your hand	1
Is this simplest	1
But you got this	1
But at what problem did you end	1
Ready go	1
Youll make a circle into a triangle	1
And loud Dan you have to speak out loud so we can understand what youre saying	1
Dean	1
Do we know how many times the line is	1
Are you guys ready for this	1
Home builders	1
But you and your partner shouldve figured out that at halfway that five right	1
Three	1
So talk it out before you write it	1
Ms Tolliver Lets just start with Logan	1
Get it	1
So when we go over it see if you can make the corrections okay	1
Nine minus four	1
Did you see what we just did	1
Is greater	1
Are you done	1
It did fall to that side didn t it	1
If I only have one of these pieces so if I were to cut it in I use that one and I still have this one left do I still have a Kleenex	1
Six dollars of his allowance	1
Raise your hand when you know	1
So then you agreed with  Robbie	1
I meant triple	1
Hadley	1
Lets go on to the next problem okay	1
That s the idea right	1
From the chalkboard to Graham	1
Vera Do you have a question	1
Is that a complete sentence	1
Well have 30 around here okay	1
Does that make sense	1
What does number three say	1
Are you talking	1
Gerald	1
Did you finish problems three and four	1
Starting on number six	1
Three	1
Zero	1
Okay because four plus nine is 13 and then remember we dont add our denominators right	1
You with me	1
You think four	1
384 plus 472 maybe	1
Could I could I get some idea of how we re coming along here	1
We have seven little cubes right	1
So Landon	1
Im a little confused	1
Stand up	1
Oh that works pretty good right	1
Did you have a calculator check your computation	1
Has anybody ever done that in math before	1
Now can you do it for an equation	1
I made dots on the paper	1
Two times bigger or double the size okay	1
Suppose in your little  stage you showed the people and the boat and the fish right	1
I would like Matty Archiel Lisa Andy Jimmy Vivian good or not so good	1
Did you want that	1
Turn and talk to your neighbor	1
And right now in the beginning we draw a diagonal line through A to C and draw a diagonal line from A to C and we will make a triangl we were able to make two right	1
We might also say length times width will give me the area right	1
Is this an okay estimate	1
Right theyre equivalent fractions right	1
Heres the thing did I have to count by tens right here	1
Would we be able to answer the question um of when the three plans would cost the same	1
Check out what happens five w divided by five is W five divided by five is one w plus one equals five D divided by five is V Is that way easier to deal with	1
Isnt that  right	1
You seriously know a lot of math things like do you know how to factor	1
Should that be in your rule	1
288	1
ignore them and you end up with 5	1
Yes	1
Yes	1
Isosceles trapezoid right	1
Kate and Natalie thats it	1
She did it wrong	1
Yes maam	1
No	1
No	1
All 11	1
I dont see any models Im looking for some models can you model this can you show it with a picture as the equations	1
Was that on your grids	1
And then heres the peppers and if theyre you	1
Yeah Brennan	1
Ravi	1
There might be a thousandths left okay	1
Alan did you just catch that error that we noticed	1
A one right Robert	1
Jason	1
Okay uh boys and girls uh for today we are going to discuss a topic okay	1
If they were the same number we could find some ways to use addition or subtraction to eliminate is that right	1
Ah because Mark has another one to ask  you go ahead Mark	1
Could we say that	1
Can you speak nice and loud Danielle	1
Did Sarah do it correctly	1
What do you think Michael	1
Is it ever going to change the outcome of the answer	1
Not going to share huh	1
Michael did you follow it	1
You all hear what David is  saying	1
Does that make sense	1
And did it work out	1
Sir can I ask you one more thing	1
I think it does make mathematical sense because they all match the plan	1
Which is nine times four right	1
Yes Ben	1
Levi	1
Shelia	1
In three weeks you spend 15 right	1
Hey do I have a remainder	1
So for like this one here that you did so to get from four to eight you multiply by two right	1
If you multiply 45	1
Judith	1
Well two halves is equal to one right	1
So I had some Smarties and person A stole some	1
I dont get it	1
Wait	1
alright number two someone on line	1
Does that make sense	1
Is two halves equal to one	1
Nia	1
Did you hear what she said	1
Yes	1
I heard some clue multiplication words right	1
Its a rotation right	1
Isnt there one more parallel line a triangle	1
Beth is your hand up or just thinking	1
Is that a straight line	1
So youve got the length of that side and the length of that side is that the same as anything Ive done	1
Fivefifths	1
Brian if you would write up that math thing that you were  just telling me about if you could explain what you were  saying about sixteen and the eight that would really help me  to think about it when I go back and read these okay	1
Does that make sense	1
Do you see how I took that one step further	1
Madeline	1
Is that correct here	1
Is that a maximum	1
Do you think that line would connect to this point	1
Brandon	1
Do I se evidence of work	1
Or here	1
So before Oscar  can do these he has to gather up all of the oranges right	1
Yeah make us all some	1
Everybody caught up	1
Yes	1
Four times the square root of 20 is eh	1
Vivian	1
So we have three total people right	1
In the classroom theres four steps	1
Every other number has a zero lets just put a zero on that one right	1
Everybody say Representation	1
He knew that there were six left here so he took Am I right that you took six from the 33	1
How many of you understood how to play it	1
Okay so did we rename a mixed number	1
Does that make sense	1
Yeah	1
That means two tens and one one Laura	1
Can can we call time out for a minute	1
Is that true here length times 1 times 1	1
Are you surprised that its fortyeight	1
Can you think of another	1
And you got three sixths	1
The area	1
Cool will you simplify it into a mixed number	1
Yes	1
Hello	1
So its twice the  twice the size	1
Is everything clear	1
How many  of you thought you shouldn t get different answers	1
Mark	1
11 and three thirds	1
Yes	1
Six	1
Do you want to find the unit rate	1
Hey Adam where are we up buddy	1
Okay so we made a little bit of an error here okay	1
Do you think so	1
and then we want to get rid of this angle right	1
Im imagining a this  instead of the purple  there	1
If this was the whole think like one then this could be three fourths	1
Square	1
Yes	1
Matt	1
Miss Tolliver	1
What	1
Youve already done it without multiplying your denominators together	1
Seven	1
Yeah Gavin	1
Yeah	1
Alright so Im going to set up a little bit more out here right	1
Kind of like an equivalent ratio	1
When we look at this one we get that much right	1
Ill erase the zero here okay	1
Emery Lucy	1
Is nine done	1
I asked it wrong right	1
Would that be helpful	1
Yeah Blaze	1
Okay so do you guys want to go next	1
You cant really see it anymore	1
William stand up	1
Division	1
Remember the other day when there was a question where you needed to subtract and others added	1
Stand up if you would prefer to find the area the whole shape and subtract the piece missing	1
And then what I would do is I would take the two and turn it into eighths so I make it more easy and minus the twofourths probably eight which would get sixfourths	1
Are the teaspoons koolaid and the cups are water	1
30	1
If we put three into the ear and we add six will it give us nine	1
Noah	1
Can I show you what I saw from some people	1
You dont understand it well	1
Julia have you come back yet	1
Yes Rose	1
How many of you guys have your answer	1
Yeah Camilla	1
Do you want me to do the first one with you	1
You put a wrong mark right	1
So if you asked me if I have five students with orange on and six students with blue on how many students are wearing Bronco colors	1
Do you all believe it	1
You said here that if you have two thirds and a half oh  there you said over here now you have to see if  you can do it with thirds is that right	1
Whats your favorite color	1
How many of you still  aren t sure you have answers but you re not totally  convinced	1
Wheres number 13	1
Okay with me	1
Okay can I actually add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators	1
Okay thumbs up if you have your paper looking like mine now	1
No one	1
What do you think	1
Youre absolutely right the smaller the denominator the bigger the piece right	1
I add the dots up on this side six and on this side	1
You couldnt read the numbers that you wrote could you	1
Okay what about Michelle Michelle and  Erin	1
Does that make sense	1
Does that make sense what hes talking about	1
One tenth right	1
Excuse me	1
You see the difference here	1
I need to know what one is before  I can tell you the number names for the others isnt that true	1
So to make this into 73 I need to multiply are you guys paying attention	1
Riley come on up	1
28 and you have 15	1
Im asking were my directions one person do it one person copy	1
Wallace	1
No	1
Just look at the median and figure out the difference between	1
It is okay from the top	1
Or you can nod your head	1
How are we doing	1
What about you	1
I got 25	1
Guys I can do hard things	1
Alex	1
Got it	1
So you would put a negative one half between negative one and negative two	1
Youre not saying that are you	1
And lets  suppose that Audra made a big model right	1
Does that sound good everybody	1
Do you see how four out of the five pieces are there	1
217	1
And I have 24 right here you agree with me	1
Paul	1
Go ahead	1
Is the  supposed to go up	1
Go and be ready to share your answer your explanation with your table group	1
Do I have enough to do two wholes	1
Its three X plus seven right	1
Are these lines parallel	1
You added nine plus eight and have 17	1
Tell somebody next to you	1
Could have there been nineteen	1
I don t have any	1
Brendan	1
So the first thing were going to do is were going to remember what it is we did okay	1
So you see if your answer is reasonable right	1
The same numbers	1
Yeah Royce	1
Whats up	1
Does that make sense	1
That you have two pieces	1
Three wholes right	1
You want to change the numerator	1
Hafasa	1
Nate	1
Are you ready for this one	1
Which one	1
Good to find equivalent fractions thats exactly what we did in yesterdays lesson right	1
Matty	1
Can you	1
Thats what its about all right	1
Are my denominators the same	1
When he removes the one light green rod  and the two red   leaving one light green rod and one  red rod his structure falls to the side of the light  green rod	1
Good	1
But shes doing that as shes putting them in the cart right	1
Anybody else think they know a secret	1
Oh so all the way where the interseT2ion is where you  can make a right Danielle	1
Yes	1
Camella can you read that sentence	1
did you use a fraction in your estimate	1
All right you ready for your assignment	1
Is it okay	1
Oh here	1
Anybody else	1
Because we are multiplying	1
Alan you have a question or a comment	1
Yes right	1
You did it so it says this triangle and the triangle over here are the same right	1
If I ask for a whole number should I see a decimal	1
At sporting events	1
Two out of the three parts	1
What did Alexander say the rule was	1
Karla	1
If the second factor is greater than one what do we know about the product Martin	1
Are they the same	1
Yes	1
Succeeded even marvelously	1
Really	1
So last week we talked all about parallelograms Right	1
One two three show me your boards	1
How are we going with ours	1
Lucy	1
Does that make sense now	1
Anybody in here have any questions on those	1
who can help me out	1
Do you all see  that	1
Tell your neighbor	1
And you  are Ashank	1
So you would have this right	1
How are you feeling	1
Who has another one	1
Who havent heard from yet	1
A quadrilateral	1
But how many of you changed your mind about what you thought after you started playing it	1
And player A only player A only won once	1
Is that right	1
Milin	1
Is that going to mess up my data when I start graphing that	1
Worked it out Mark	1
Kelly	1
And when we talk about the graphic organizer kind of at the end of this lesson then remember you know were going to remember what we said about vertex right	1
Isnt that closer to a two than it is to three	1
Shivani	1
Or am I getting smaller	1
Jonathan	1
Since we want to lose this angle so this hm isnt it a little bent	1
It might look like its close to one but is it	1
Everybody get that	1
How about the height	1
There are two empty columns and three columns together	1
Am I going to multiply them	1
Does oneninth plus onethird equal four ninths	1
Meredith	1
So you already have an arm right	1
Do you see the box which says The whole	1
Okay	1
Oh you need another  light green you know I dont think we have any for the  overhead so maybe we could just use one of the regular  why  dont we try those ok	1
No its not me I dont want to read it but do you need me to read it	1
Friends stand up if you are number four at your team	1
I think it should go more towards zero	1
Counted	1
Raise your hand if you think that that is threesixth	1
Asher	1
John	1
Its impossible to fully isolate the radicals so you are in a boat on this problem where when you square both sides you better not just distribute the exponent right	1
Is this making sense to both of you	1
Meredith you have your hand up	1
Skyler does that makes sense	1
Zoey	1
So this is where we start using graphing for realworld purposes right	1
Have any of you ever dived	1
What	1
Winnie	1
That is understanding an area model okay	1
One	1
Can you talk a little bit louder so that the people know the other side of	1
Huh	1
Are you raising your hand	1
Zoe you hear me	1
And I would like to bring my family over for dinner to have tuna noodle casserole and do you guys know what I said	1
When we do showdown when everybody is done if everybodys good then you stand up right	1
class	1
Hunter	1
Oh so were back to Terrell and he climbed four different buildings right	1
Can I ask you something then can we do the same thing for the  white rods	1
Is that the only way	1
Everybody	1
Do you think you understand how to pull this number sentence out of a number story	1
Are those the fractions you wrote Missy	1
Therell be point fifty after seven	1
Brendan	1
Hey Astrid Im ready for you sweetie	1
Thats a domain restriction right	1
Yes	1
You like to see all the numbers	1
Turn and talk to your partner	1
Ive heard  close to	1
It was homework	1
Did anybody draw a picture	1
You will have one leftover which you can cut it	1
And	1
Do you want to keep doing the next one Soren	1
If you have a noticing I want you to type it in the chat	1
I had c2	1
Somebody	1
Does anybody have any questions about that	1
One person	1
There	1
Yeah I was confused at what she said	1
So wed have 39	1
You want to say it to the camera or to everybody	1
So when I inscribe it when should I do it	1
So I have divided my area model up into four different sections okay	1
So do you understand why it was not the right way to do it	1
But was it that long	1
Are you ready	1
Danielle	1
Because its the wrong answer	1
Those are kind of the ones that we focus on right	1
So how did    Did you use the same rule again	1
Animals	1
Are these tests	1
Nineteen	1
Did you get 1410	1
Are you guys actually writing down	1
Well its	1
Three is rolled twice	1
Nate	1
Person number two stand up	1
And 10 more apples	1
Yes	1
Thirteen	1
Yes or no	1
Does anybody have questions about that game	1
The calculators not going past a million	1
Does that make sense	1
Probably the soda water	1
Is there enough water for everyone	1
So did you already cut the straw	1
Its what youre trying to solve	1
Ordinarily they wouldnt bargain would they	1
One times 12 is 12	1
Okay ready	1
Separated	1
The actual heading says Polygon doesnt it	1
Ones that we drew through B D and drew a parallel line through vertex A are this and this okay	1
Rogelio	1
Yes no	1
Three thirds so a fourth would be bigger than the whole right	1
Its not a question exactly about this but what if you have an odd number and you try to	1
Double if I multiplied it by three	1
Eight	1
Addisons the only one that actually was here the day we taught that	1
And you d just get that moving to like 1 times 1 2 times 2 3 times 3 and 4 times 4	1
Any questions	1
Dominic your hand is up what	1
Did everyone hear what Mariana just said	1
When Im looking at word problems like this I like to circle in there the information thats important right	1
Is the value of the expression less than 790 plus 212	1
Alyssa	1
Because its a whole fraction	1
Ezra	1
Valerie	1
Ready	1
Well see if you	1
Yes	1
So this is the rule that you invented	1
Do you think Queen Ann is going to be happy about your suggestion	1
Yes	1
I got A and then 27	1
And when you are done with these I want you to stand up	1
So you re telling me I have one meter of white ribbon and I  split it in half I have two bows	1
What was the question again	1
Kaysen Im not sure what youre pasting into the answer boxes but it doesnt look like what were up to right now okay	1
If I put in the chat box What if we did something like 03 Or no 04	1
So two and two fourths	1
Oh are you good	1
Would it help you to make an estimate with that	1
So if you think you have an argument Erik thinks he does raise  your hand	1
Do you need me to guide some questions for you	1
what	1
So you guys added	1
27 36 49 54	1
Okay so well split this up into 10s and 1s right	1
Composing	1
Does that make sense	1
Theyre The same	1
Raise your hand if you followed what  David said	1
Hey you guys taught him pretty well then huh	1
Erik	1
Thats one whole right	1
Yeah yeah yeah	1
Jacquelyn	1
OK Milin	1
I did it to the side	1
Ok wait maybe Im wrong  what did you say	1
Robbie	1
Do you guys have any questions you would like to talk about before we move on	1
Do you understand my problem	1
And I am going to give you what do you need	1
You dont understand	1
Anybody online have any questions on these six practice problems	1
So both of these look like theyre greater than one half right	1
All right go ahead and turn and talk to your partner decide whos going to go first	1
Who is number eight	1
Seven	1
What should you be doing right now	1
I dont change the size of the pieces do I	1
All right Mr Zach you are the lucky	1
Nine times twothirds is going to be greater than twothirds	1
Do we need to change any of the numbers that are being multiplied	1
Too big right	1
The red	1
In this case its a number right	1
Factor	1
Its a problem like this okay	1
Well one daughter will Is it clear shes going to keep half	1
Thats fine	1
The answer	1
Mom I still have a question	1
I want you to talk to your partners	1
So 35 equals R Okay	1
Excellent job okay so Landon Im going to come to you now Landon are you frozen	1
Raise your hands if you think you know	1
Are we	1
Did you get to check yours	1
for that one	1
Raul are you guys ready	1
Do you remember that	1
Did you hear your friends	1
All right how we doing	1
So go for it Raul	1
Madison	1
Raise your hand if you found a fraction circle that you think we could make an equivalent to one third	1
Mmhmm	1
Does everyone have a piece of paper that looks like mine	1
So if I have my 40 and Im dividing it by nine because those were my cards correct	1
Those all did this but did these do that	1
Is anybody else willing to let us see their journal how they wrote down the rule or the pattern	1
Not a lot of thinking right	1
A number sentence to me is an equation of multiple digits to make a new number	1
Are you working	1
Does that seem fair	1
I have to go	1
Mason	1
Do you guys see this is an example of how coordinate grids can be helpful for you to organize data	1
I wrote an A and a B right	1
Did you hear that what Andrew said	1
Does that make sense to you guys	1
I know it looks sort of pink doesn t it	1
Asher	1
Yes Nate	1
Its two by two	1
Show me	1
If you are using your resources you should be able to turn around and read that number in the value it is which then helps you say it right	1
I thought thats  what you are saying	1
Explain talk to one another	1
Maybe	1
Do you guys remember this	1
Laura	1
make sense	1
Talk to your table	1
You guys ready	1
Is that right	1
Are you ready	1
Up to where did you get to	1
Oh so you want me to just check six real quick right	1
Peter	1
To what	1
We can do that right	1
When you think you got seven out of seven is that 100	1
So wherever its doubleshaded right	1
Tristan	1
Ok my next question is can you make one that shows the  comparison of three quarters and two thirds thats bigger than this	1
Yes	1
Then is it just this side where we can draw parallel lines	1
You have to add a number that makes 400	1
Do you understand	1
So the parenthesis come first so its eight divided by four by four is 16 is eight divided by 16 minus two	1
You can say it	1
Go ahead	1
For question number two at the bottom	1
It is A B C D E is it	1
These are not easy to do are they	1
And you can count them	1
Larry Im stupid	1
Well if you didnt have opposites we only have eight	1
But I am busy correcting	1
Youve got to get the vocabulary right	1
Isnt it	1
Whats that	1
Classy classy	1
Christian and Michael does that make sense	1
Of course my question then is could there be more than  six	1
All right are you ready	1
All right ready	1
Okay John	1
Menhir	1
Do they get on trays	1
They have an interesting  David has  an interesting theory I dont know if Meredith heard it tell them his  theory now listen carefully Jackie you want to hear this theory	1
Nobodys showing me then we dont need any time	1
Like this Madam	1
Have you ever heard of the word decomposing	1
Are you changing your mind	1
Maybe this time  you want to use your stones for that	1
Oh wait	1
Negative 10 okay	1
Are you trying	1
Anyway do you know why youre here	1
Okay Ethan	1
Think they do	1
Now number one read the directions for number one	1
We just had two right	1
And on our basis of  our discussion I want you to hand in the one you have  but I want you to make me another one Okay	1
Twentysix times two is fifty two and I am subtracting two minus two and that is fifty	1
What did you want to say	1
You dont understand at all okay	1
Briella	1
You think its easier to get from five to one and one third	1
Okay so two fourths would be the same as one half	1
So thats equivalent right	1
Go ahead	1
Matteo	1
can I restate that	1
That the quart if you split it in half it goes into pint	1
That accurately represent what I want	1
No you did your perfect math and its good	1
Well guess what	1
Ankur	1
Chloe quickly turn and share with Julia	1
Is it equal equal to negative negative four	1
Brian	1
Okay you can take a moment now and talk to your shoulder partner	1
I do	1
And four of them	1
Thats what Im hearing you say	1
This line is a descending line can you also tell that from the equation	1
Twentynine	1
Extension	1
What	1
Make sense	1
Thats right huh	1
So those work	1
Any other questions	1
You know what	1
Do we know the base of the triangle in part B	1
Is  that right Mr Purdy	1
Or does it really not matter	1
s36 plus four right	1
Eliza	1
You may return to your seats okay	1
Harper	1
One	1
I dont I didnt get it	1
Claire	1
Anybody have any questions about those	1
Perfect Toby	1
Down below I wrote twoeighths and for the third one I wrote oneeighth	1
Remember that	1
You have another one	1
Good	1
Can you guys count by two	1
Lonnie	1
No one wants to try	1
Its going to be eight	1
I believe that the five would be greater because it is onethe other five times 8687 86 is still one lower than the whole total	1
Hold on he says its going to be more than thirteen	1
Yes	1
And then I went redred red blueblueblue blueredblue redblueblue blueblue red redredblue redbluered blueredred	1
I dont have fourths in my one that I made	1
Two thirds okay	1
Olivia	1
Isnt that what wed get	1
Jake can	1
And can you see on the overhead how  many whites those of you who dont have enough	1
Do you know your team numbers	1
3 x 0 is 0 right	1
Kada	1
Can I have number Whos number 27	1
Im missing a subject right	1
No the X coordinate	1
We can use partial products or what we called it on Tuesday multiplication wrestling right	1
Yeah	1
Isnt there anything like this over here okay	1
15	1
Any questions on part A	1
Linda	1
Does it matter	1
Okay	1
That makes sense now	1
Does six go into 36	1
This is for the data were going to work on your chocolate chip cookie one right	1
Do you get this part	1
All right sir it looks like youre being left out here arent you	1
Valarie your brain is just going going whats up	1
Does it matter	1
Patrick	1
Remember were just shooting some baskets are throwing some passes right	1
Is that two	1
And Franc give me another two digit number please	1
Because thats a 12 and a 13 pink and orange	1
Yes	1
Did I have to count back	1
Angelina I am so sorry but Ill finish this afternoon okay	1
equal	1
Can you use 10 as your first partial quotient	1
Does everything I say make sense so far	1
Okay go ahead Stephanie	1
Everybody wants to change their minds	1
Alve are you partner A or partner B	1
Remember	1
Are you guys writing this together	1
All right any questions on these definitions	1
Are you with me so far	1
Now can I use my sixths to help me figure out how many lines Ive got to twelve	1
So this would be a mixed number right	1
So Im going play a beat and youre going to clap on every other beat okay	1
So are you looking at these words in blue	1
You dont have fourths	1
1000000000 right	1
Anybody online	1
I couldnt help but overhearing that and Im also talking to  David here but I have a question for you and David to think about  Ok	1
I just took this shape and moved it over here	1
So first we did five times seven because we took the five tickets times seven days right	1
And then now you want to change  your mind	1
Please just tell everybody what you told me	1
1 2 3	1
Three	1
Or the people who arent sure want to tell us  what they are confused about	1
Four so if Don has four does he have one fewer than Jim  cuz Jim has three	1
Okay	1
Would I have called it a half	1
Do you have any data to back that up	1
Are they going to be the same numbers	1
Can I show you guys something real quick	1
Isnt it good	1
One tenth	1
Yes	1
So for that all you have to do is use that symbol right	1
One plus one equals	1
James	1
Grayson	1
Is there anything misleading about it	1
Mr Jean	1
How would it why wouldnt it be threefourths	1
Oh do you want to try	1
Is there another denominator we could use instead of 24 and get the right answer	1
Lionel	1
Not really	1
Then 2  3 would be 4	1
Is everybody ready	1
Yeah you	1
So you will be using division and estimating it so that it makes sense that you can come up with an actual type of answer okay	1
You too Shelly you haven t played with this in a while so you can help me	1
In all	1
The goal is could you have predicted this without putting it into your calculator based on the story	1
Right Zach Im gonna ask a question are partial quotients easier for you to solve division wise than the other way	1
If we reflected B over the X axis it would be right here right	1
Or did they just say its a big sale	1
But in the second its easy to calculate	1
Does that make sense	1
Alan	1
Any questions on that page	1
Theyre equivalent fractions because they are each a half but theyre just different	1
Hunter	1
Do you remember	1
Does it work	1
Has anybody checked five for this problem does it work	1
Sort of	1
Everyone over here what did I just say	1
So three kids come and they bring all of their oranges to Oscar right	1
So were multiplying this by more than one right	1
Andrew	1
A basket of fruit	1
So can we use multiplication Jackson to get this one	1
In the traditional	1
Huh	1
And then maybe divided that by two	1
Its always opposite though	1
Do you see the parentheses	1
Do you follow what he s saying	1
Look at them on any of the tools that Im giving here	1
Perimeter of a square youll be able to remember that yes	1
Andrew	1
And this ones equation three right	1
Three	1
Okay Emily	1
Oh could you find one	1
Kimberly	1
You want to come up here	1
Are you saying for example that  that six comes up by adding	1
How many  would like to hear it a second time	1
Lucia did you have a question	1
So if I have one five thats five fifths right	1
Did you find what you thought you would  find	1
Any question about how to play	1
Okay do you have five squared plus 12 squared	1
I think sometimes with 5th graders you get in a habit of Oh we re working on adding fractions so you know what	1
Bridger	1
Um ok thats very interesting um most of the  hands were up but I guess Brian yours wasnt up no	1
Im sorry what	1
Turn to the person next to you	1
How many of you do that kind of in  your heads	1
So you just did three sides	1
B C D similar to triangle A  C E  Okay any questions in here on these	1
All right you ready	1
Stand up if youve used this strategy before multiplying two denominators together	1
Are you able to solve these things	1
So is this a function	1
I would agree with you that its common multiple because were counting by that number right	1
Landon went good	1
So if I were to  say things like one half one third one fourth one fifth right	1
Do you see how the half becomes fourths	1
Ethan	1
Do you understand	1
Isnt it the same thing	1
Yes	1
You  two need to talk to each other	1
maybe	1
Whats up Wallace	1
Michelle	1
Erik	1
Asher	1
EH	1
And what  are you telling me thats the 3	1
Its going to look different because youre multiplying one part	1
Here also	1
Yes	1
Are we changing the amount	1
66	1
Yes	1
And Tam	1
Any more comments	1
Lets try that again	1
Johnny	1
Today feels better right	1
No more than	1
What	1
Then would you use that to be able to do this without having the calculator	1
Yeah	1
Jonas	1
No	1
I got it right	1
Then   you want 2 blues stuck apart not stuck apart took apart	1
You sure	1
Water	1
Youre saying one gets 13 and then the other two get 16	1
Okay everybody ready for the rest	1
Ivanna	1
Well what what is You have A divided by B right	1
Turn and talk to your partner	1
Marian what is it	1
If  you put them together you only get six	1
A right	1
Do they work	1
So I got ninefifths	1
And I said to all of you I want you to go and  make me a model of two children right and theyre sitting at a dock  and theyre fishing and they just caught a fish right	1
What	1
Im going to ask you to leave what you have here stop  do your math boxes okay	1
Now Im going to take that 34650 with the decimals here right	1
If we use this compared to 30 milliliters right	1
Bella	1
Yes	1
Money or quarters right	1
Because I divided it by half 22	1
Thank you	1
read it	1
20 x 4	1
Does it matter	1
It doubles right	1
Go ahead	1
Negative 21	1
Did we get a little bit tired	1
Three	1
No no ideas	1
Does Thatgood everybody	1
Did you know that that was a property	1
That makes sense	1
and then you have to  take the whole and then make it to eight and then subtract it	1
Evenly right	1
Just four people is it	1
You get a triangle like this	1
Youre only doing problem number what	1
Is that a two	1
You said nine divided by a third is the same as nine times  three	1
Yes Bren	1
People who say they were able to do both	1
Do you want a hand	1
Which problem did you complete	1
All right so that one is one that Im assuming more than 74 of you guys knows how to calculate a mean right	1
We worked with powered numbers that had the same main numbers Vasek	1
What	1
Kate	1
I think so	1
Positive one third right	1
How many  of you would like to continue working with this	1
Oh	1
Well I think they might both be answers	1
Got it	1
Remember	1
Found	1
Two and one half	1
Do we agree	1
Does that make sense	1
Can I show you a tool you can use	1
But if they are  13 meter you can only make 3 of them	1
Isaac	1
Yes	1
But if I break that into ninths if I label it one ninth two ninths I dont have enough ninths do I	1
So the dividend everybody say dividend	1
One	1
Anybody	1
Fatima Whats up	1
I got it	1
Richard will you read the learning intention please	1
You noticed things like this on this side right	1
Isaiah	1
Who would like to share questions they have	1
Okay so if we look at the very first one we are going to two fifth plus one fourth okay	1
So if you use the paperfolding way when we shaded one way then we shaded it another color or if youre just using the area model where it shows the onethird of twofifths okay	1
That means it changed here right	1
You also know how to figure out a triangle yes	1
Well if you made a number line and you took a magnifying glass or a microscope and put  your number line under it you would see that you have a lot of room left to put the one hundredth onethousandth and the onemillionth	1
You multiplied	1
Bill has	1
Less than	1
Do I have someone who would be willing to share even if they didnt get it right	1
24	1
You want to add to make it improper up here	1
No	1
Do the rest  of you see that	1
Anyone	1
Do our denominators match	1
Jakki	1
The idea that one team might be better than the other	1
I think it was both of them isnt that what I said	1
Three	1
15	1
If Javier or Tanner or Daniel doesnt get it is it really good Diana does	1
Yes	1
So we need to multiply the lower equation by three okay	1
That part I asked you to okay	1
Because they didnt use the same coordinates otherwise if they did itd be in the	1
Cause iStudentt that dont you have A squared three times	1
And join that and then join these together and found the measurements of the	1
Im sorry what	1
Ka	1
No	1
How many materials they need	1
Do you understand what your job is	1
Below the uh	1
So dont we want to put these into groups of 365	1
No	1
Um	1
So sometimes if what youre rounding to is very close to the next number youre going to have to round up a couple of numbers right	1
And place let s say numbers between zero and three or negative one and two or negative two and two and see what you would come up with	1
So you didnt just pull them out of the air	1
Is there a smaller number in here that I can divide six into	1
Nice and loud Kelly	1
Yes	1
Three cubed	1
If you plugged a trillion in does this matter	1
You see what I mean	1
Y 192X	1
Yeah	1
How did you guys got three and onethird	1
Ricardo youll catch on quick I promise okay	1
Can I get everybody s attention for a second	1
Can you see it	1
Yes	1
No	1
Isnt it normally just	1
And they go into this category the ones that dont get anything added go into that one	1
Mason	1
Which number	1
First of all are there any special questions	1
Wong Yee Hung sorry Wong Yee Ling	1
You see why	1
That	1
So you said you thought three fourths was closer to a whole right	1
Talk  table	1
now I still have to subtract this dont I	1
So how many of you by show of hands think that you understand why it is but cant explain it	1
So would that mean I go 4 12 4 34 5 and so on	1
You sure about that one	1
Can you come up and show us	1
Do you understand the problem	1
Yes	1
Is that what the problem is	1
Huh	1
Is it in the ones place	1
So we talked about different strategies right	1
Its	1
Who wants to read the definition of a prism	1
Read me what you have	1
Only do one five three and seven A and D One five three seven A and D If seven A and D refer to a problem you didnt do just do use one that you did okay	1
Robin	1
Sydney	1
So the very first one was I dont know you might have two as the X and three as the Y thats how it works right	1
No meaning	1
Am I good	1
Okay Dominic	1
An estimation is just usually fifth graders when they make an estimate they are trying to help themselves be sure that their answers are correct when they do the actual calculation does that make sense	1
Anybody online have any questions	1
Raise your hand if you got the answer	1
It come from when you just make it four on top of a one	1
You need a half	1
Its like how far away from your car you are is what this graph is showing okay	1
Lucy	1
Yes	1
Do you remember this	1
Lucille	1
Does that make sense	1
Is Suma right	1
And I multiplied it wrong	1
Ella	1
But if you think about the order of operations do you need any kind of  parentheses here	1
Well it has one more possibility	1
Yes	1
Now a new team claims that one  half is bigger than a quarter by an eighth	1
Yeah Adeline	1
Yes	1
Why is what there	1
Is there anything wrong with that	1
Thats right huh	1
Anybody else	1
On three were going to read it together	1
Is that factorable	1
Jenna	1
How are we feeling	1
Yes Lucia	1
Make sure you check with your  teammates you dont go rogue and just enter whatever you want	1
Does it work for the others	1
What is it	1
So what do we have here	1
How much money can Mr Swanson take to the store so you said 304	1
All you have to do is decrease it right	1
The sides	1
They have their order for their numbers switched right	1
Youre going to glue it where its supposed to go so am I going to glue my tenths on my whole	1
We well they were talking about doing a circle	1
Actually I dont want to	1
If you are done give me a thumbs up	1
Yeah Valarie go for it	1
Remember that multiplication like 35 53 same thing right	1
Huh	1
No the length of this like how much apart	1
I think it would be equal to because threefourths times three over three is the same as threefourths times one	1
Negative number	1
How did you get three and one	1
Ok now you said there was another way you could do it  three times twentyseven you said you could multiply it  rather than add it three times	1
Is that pretty straightforward	1
Does that make any more sense	1
Four	1
Can we come back another time	1
Blake are you done writing this	1
Okay Camila stand up	1
So now lets talk about um Eriks theory Erik says  now that the white one on this model the larger model  where we called one the train that was made up of two  orange and one purple right	1
Any questions so far	1
Your partner is number one	1
I think I know	1
Can we finish having a conversation about the first part	1
Yes Seth is pretty good	1
Do they look like sailboats	1
Can you raise your hands a little	1
Inches	1
That concept you also have to understand and master okay	1
Yeah n n represents	1
So this is a sample answer huh	1
Lefthand side is it expanded form	1
Damien	1
No	1
Youre not going to add this 21 on the same side	1
Yes	1
27	1
And that  would therefore enable you to put them in the same place on  the number line	1
Would you be like no	1
You want me to wait until you get number 10 done	1
And you think you can do it on your own now	1
Thats too big right	1
Who has the letter C	1
Does that clarify	1
Are our denominators	1
You dont know	1
Would it be a good idea to use a grid to make this work	1
So this piece would have to have one more piece right	1
You do huh	1
Show me youre done by putting your finger on your nose	1
So you guys are finding a common denominator right	1
I said it would move to the left and get a little wider	1
Work the problem all the way through okay	1
Start talking telling Mae	1
Its not equal	1
For the singing	1
17	1
Can you bargain and lower the price	1
Now there is who has already finished calculating	1
Is that the same	1
Do the number names change	1
Now don t tell them your nice method of writing it OK	1
What we want to do is take this second  sentence here  how many 16s are in 1   and change it completely to a number  sentence ok	1
Yes	1
Ben	1
Its the same number	1
Yeah And there are six meters is in  each and it would be two thirds is one two thirds is again  and two thirds left	1
Anybody else	1
You can write it in your journal right	1
The data shows us 12 inches right	1
We dont know what cards hes using	1
So did we ever have sound on the same beat	1
Did anyone think about it like  that in terms of money	1
I know it I know it	1
Has person number 4 already gone through	1
To 10	1
Let me show here	1
Wait box times box minus seven times box plus how much	1
If you went from about 16500 to about 18200 is that really times two	1
Im sorry what	1
We know that A and B are the same right	1
Can you hold them higher	1
Okay so when you do an estimate it needs to be just like that okay	1
So were talking about the length of the red rod  the length of the red rod is the same as the length of the two  white rods	1
Rather than meeting with a partner because were coming down on time Im going to come around and make sure that you got the ones I wanted you to get right right okay	1
Do you understand where your mistake was made	1
How many poodles	1
Do you have any questions	1
Youre lucky	1
Yes	1
Times two	1
Is your answers going to be a fraction	1
or a plot goes up right	1
Whittny	1
I think its one sixth	1
Go	1
If you do that you get a triangle right	1
How many of you used the exact words X coordinate Y coordinate	1
James come up here	1
IStudentt this A two A squared times A squared times A squared	1
You want to take away the two	1
That would be more	1
So she looked at it as just 9 times 3 and then knew that it would be 270 right	1
Yes	1
The greater than symbol goes in right	1
So instead of saying The two numerators and the two denominators it could end up being that theres three you know what Im saying	1
Probably find an estimate right	1
You said two of those little white ones were two twelfths right	1
Does he have one  fewer side by side	1
Did you get dark green to be a half	1
Two	1
Divide	1
Is that cool with you	1
We had three right	1
Have you measured it	1
Julia	1
One and 16 fifths	1
Does that make sense crew	1
You could imagine a meter right	1
Any more questions	1
Partner A go for it	1
Andrew got it	1
Could I be 13 eighths of the way to my parents house	1
Or 34 times 54 which is 154	1
How	1
Okay let s go on to the next one with Eric	1
Yes	1
Just looking at median does that tell us that Bob is a better surfer than Ben	1
Who wants to volunteer	1
I knew I was missing something because I just realized that as soon as you put the as soon as you did the denominators I knew what I did wrong	1
Well you re supposed to like  there s one meter of white  ribbon and then you have to split it into um a half so I got  um two bows	1
Is that what Im hearing you say Xavier	1
Natalie	1
Graham	1
Who said he or she got group fours	1
Oh I have to move that to four or to two right	1
Uh	1
Were going to do a few more practice problems when you guys come back this afternoon okay	1
Five	1
Martin do you have a question	1
I could ask you a question and say Hey is two a factor of 56	1
Stand when youve got your answers	1
Ichiro still has more huh	1
A lot of like a whole	1
Do we have any other questions from  the audience	1
Veronika	1
You guys  are on half a meter	1
You ve got it	1
I did	1
If you multiply the 230yen cakes at this price by X then youll get the total cost right	1
So Abigailla did she write them correctly	1
If you were to do 1200 you would get 1000 200	1
What	1
Michael Onderzak	1
Yeah but but what you did is you said there are  three times and there are three times again and there  are three times again right	1
Horizontal	1
Its not a 12 of a 13 its	1
Paul alright go ahead	1
Then cant this be found by calculation	1
Is there a question on this exercise 948	1
Robert how about you	1
You have a different answer	1
Yes Adeline	1
100000 squared miles	1
Whole	1
Its a half	1
Amazing right	1
Right Patrick	1
Yes	1
Go ahead	1
Walker	1
What  about the next one if I have one meter of ribbon and I have  to make bows that are one third meter in length how many  of you think you know that answer to that one	1
You know what	1
You have a different number	1
He thought that 9 cups is used for 1 ingredient	1
I want to call on somebody to help	1
The diagonal line isnt done okay	1
No here you doubled the first one right	1
Landon	1
Okay Mr Zach Im gonna come to you	1
No the upper one times the lower one	1
All you have to do is get rid of it right	1
Is that what youre asking	1
Really	1
Is the rate of change constant	1
Does that make sense	1
Addisona	1
What are you saying Michelle	1
No	1
The whole is two thirds	1
How many of you think they are the  same	1
Nolan	1
Do you know what youre supposed to do	1
Did you check it	1
Nathan what does it say	1
So an incorrect answer	1
So it would have been point three	1
Chan Wai Yan	1
Landon and Penelope come up	1
I dont know	1
slices of pizza did Leon eat	1
minusing	1
So I already know that I have to turn it into twelves right	1
Lets go to Janessa	1
Yes	1
Talk with your partner	1
Yeah Cooper	1
So theres a is there an ad	1
Right	1
Especially and this might be helpful when you are proving it	1
Times two	1
This is only one because if you call the orange a  ten and the ones equal to a ten when you call  this  a one then theyre going to  change to a one	1
Do you see in the first statement how purple come first	1
Juliana	1
No Im confused	1
Anyone want to share	1
Kathleen	1
So I solved it but I dont understand	1
Yes	1
Yes	1
Do I have windows on this side	1
I noticed that too	1
Um yeah well maybe	1
Um	1
How many of you could imagine what it looks like even  though you havent quite built it	1
Is that okay	1
Is  Dan adding these numbers or are you doing all the work here	1
Do we need that extra zero	1
And this is the same here	1
So they can be subtracted by each other okay	1
So is that where the three is coming from	1
Mr Josh	1
Compared to maybe somebody elses	1
Are you watching	1
Okay whats the next one	1
Are you really sure	1
No Winnie	1
You guys doing okay	1
So when we were doing it  can we think of this to go up there	1
Show me with your fingers from a one two three or four your understanding of the chart before we start because youre going to have to use that to solve the problems	1
Yeah	1
I  um showed the numbers the number in square inches and added the numbers like 28	1
Would you come back	1
Did you do your multiplication and then your subtraction right	1
You understand less or stayed the same	1
Thats all good everybody	1
Beg your pardon	1
Okay like equivalent fractions	1
You wont get any numbers right	1
Do our data tables always say X and Y coordinates	1
Should we use our math monster for this	1
Is that the first thing you do on the problems unit	1
So what percent  Go for it Campbell	1
123	1
Three wholes	1
If I can change this to denominator 10 will I be able to add	1
So so what is Meredith saying here	1
A quart	1
Twothirds of eight were Are you listening to me	1
Five is bigger because its a whole number	1
What were you gonna say Shae	1
Can you still use multiplication	1
Who had a thumbs down	1
I counted out three by three on the boxes which is nine and then I saw two by two so I multiplied that which is six and then I just moved	1
And a few hints would be like hey did you learn did you understand	1
How are you	1
Haley	1
Cooper	1
How many stories did he climb in all	1
How how about this polygon	1
Allen	1
Its getting hard to do this isnt it	1
Does anyone have any other followup questions they would like to ask	1
But you could imagine they are all the same but here we don t have rods we have inches right	1
I want you to come up with a strategy or rule okay	1
Diego	1
are they the same	1
Huh	1
Then you were doing fifty four times ten which is five hundred and forty	1
Yeah	1
Vertical	1
What	1
The answer your question Lila	1
Could this have been just two times 10 not 10 to the first power	1
Okay Ethan go	1
How about Devon	1
Hans	1
Some of you arent sure how many of you arent sure	1
Yeah	1
Oh we need to divide  right	1
Who has an idea for what we could do you guys see how Im marking this up to what Im doing	1
Leslie you have the next one the blue one for B	1
How  many of you can imagine	1
I didnt know that we were supposed to divide by 365 so I divided by one	1
Like what are you	1
Yes	1
Im doing this part of the 35 and 710 and I cant really understand	1
Without moving close to them okay	1
And we are going to go into todays lesson okay	1
You noticed a lot huh	1
Remember how we decompose the number	1
No	1
Here	1
The perimeter	1
Do you know what youre doing	1
Harold	1
Stand when you are done please	1
I just finally got it	1
So is everything okay	1
Go	1
Now is it possible to have a decimal where we do have wholes	1
No we didnt we could get like fiftieths	1
Hey Todd will you read our learning intentions for today	1
Yeah	1
You and your partner go	1
No	1
Raise your hand	1
Have a label	1
River	1
Yeah go ahead	1
Yes	1
So if I go in with 15 can I come out with 15	1
Classidy class	1
Did you list the coordinates	1
Yes	1
Now youve gotta On your plot youre going to have to show those five numbers yes	1
You know what	1
Does that make sense	1
So do you see that if I write it that way	1
With one zero	1
So youre thinking if you had more different size rods	1
If I made that 1 negative again that would turn it back to a positive right	1
So now youre going to now try five in there right	1
Okay so we know we cant do 2 can we	1
How about this	1
The difference about it being written as a fraction instead of it being part to whole this is part and I want you to write this in part two parts okay	1
It disappears right	1
Sorry	1
No one	1
What does the question say	1
Take your maths books out and work on some maths for a few minutes okay	1
No	1
Yes	1
So would that work	1
Yeah I guess you could say that	1
Did you just say point	1
One hundred ninetysix square meters	1
180 minus 148 does 32 sound right	1
Umm	1
Im going to go to Corey and then I want Stone to share because Stones is different than what Ive heard so far	1
Question	1
Does that make sense	1
crosstalk	1
Okay get the idea	1
They looked inside of each others wallets right	1
Can you imagine the model	1
Are you Brandon	1
Then write in X milliliters in the figure and this relationship okay	1
So if I have 17 divided by 100 Im going to write 17 as a whole number right	1
Okay go please	1
Did you write it down	1
Next whos next	1
Logan	1
Exactly	1
So 1615 Theodore	1
Gallon	1
Yes	1
Did you do some stuff	1
Now my pen color is black	1
See	1
So now we know that one third is equal to two sixths right	1
Ray I think you said yes at first right	1
All right are you ready for your assignments	1
Does it work for 1	1
Daniel are you raising your hand for	1
By six	1
You did check the rest of your work yes	1
Bergen	1
Was there one or two	1
Three hats for 15	1
Anybody get to that	1
Did you add it all up	1
Patrick	1
Rory	1
Do I see my beautiful parabola	1
Is that the same thing as this	1
Can you try the next one on your own	1
Okay so if I take this okay	1
casserole that group B took	1
When you are done stand up please	1
Is it easier to plug one into that	1
Alex	1
Mm hmm	1
Talk to your neighbor	1
No	1
Multiply it by two	1
Two whole candy bars	1
What	1
Raise your hand if you forgot how to make an equivalent fraction	1
The square	1
Yes	1
If you think about on a computer have you ever made a picture bigger and all of a sudden you actually drag it too far to the side and it just looks super weird	1
Beth you come up with her	1
Double	1
Go ahead	1
From this blue ribbon	1
What are you waiting for	1
Lets hear from Meredith and then  well hear from you because Meredith gave me one before I said  no thatll take us probably a week	1
I wanted to  because when youre multiplying something youre breaking it up in smaller parts and stuff	1
Who has got B	1
Any questions so far on that one	1
Diana you dont know what a number sentence is	1
Let s count with me	1
When we look at our list of fractions theres something in common right	1
Its okay if this and this are the same right	1
Im talking about Liliths age here and Noahs age here right	1
But I would dots right	1
Yes	1
Okay are there any of these that I can go over with you or I can explain it for you	1
You said you carried three times seven is twentyone why  dont you write that down three times seven is twentyone	1
So I want you to work with your shoulder partner	1
I made these	1
Also	1
Did you read it	1
I really hope that you help out your older brothers and sisters you dont think so Amy	1
The 15 one	1
All right what was your question Isaiah	1
Priscilla	1
No	1
Malcome call on someone please	1
before the test right	1
I was trying to check it on my paper but I couldn t make sense of it	1
Asher	1
We were looking at the circumference and area of the circle and the difference	1
Evy is that a hand up	1
Does anybody want to read the instructions on how to make it	1
Jalen	1
For what	1
Isnt that true	1
No	1
It doesnt make sense to me	1
How many of  you understood Erik s argument	1
Remember what I asked who started with 112	1
Is 35 more than a whole	1
Tamara	1
Then its tedious to count these right	1
Talk to your team	1
On this one	1
So did you hear that Duke	1
Then Daishi	1
What else can I help you guys with	1
So now looking at the way I did it Im not going to go 14 24 34 44 am I	1
Aiden	1
Yes we are writing for the method for multiplying fractions discovered in class and were writing about paper folding	1
So now lets talk about um Eriks  theory Erik says now that the white one on this model the larger  model where we called one the train that was made up of two  orange and one purple right	1
Yes	1
Both of them have 6 white spaces	1
Are you sure	1
You can read it out loud together but everybody try C on their own and then you compare okay	1
Julia	1
Milin can you try and stand somewhere and we are going   to ask you to put some of these glass things into that bag but don t do it yet and Milin maybe it s going to work   better if you stand on the end of the table there	1
Partner A on your marks get set	1
Raphael	1
Lets not make it a  sea monster and lets change it a little bit theyre fishing and  then their boat is docked somewhere do you understand	1
So the double shaded is what group A ate okay	1
Michael	1
Mia	1
Yeah	1
D Auden	1
Go ahead Ronnie	1
Thats six	1
Can you do that	1
Tom come talk to me	1
But I looked in the answer booklet and it was wrong	1
If I asked you to solve this do you think you could	1
Briella	1
What about 28	1
Or anything	1
270000	1
Its wider	1
You cant split 17 into thirds	1
12	1
Three	1
Does anyone in this group	1
Andrew	1
If I fold it this like this and then I  measure it like this this is half of two meters right	1
Mari Can you try one more time	1
Xavier	1
Actually it just is that quick isnt it	1
That one is a	1
Did you share with your partner	1
With that	1
Aiden	1
They are giving you a deal	1
Fernando do you want to answer this	1
Sonia	1
Wrote A and B	1
Right now you are a ruler	1
So lets try a different one are you ready	1
I now know my new denominator is 24 right	1
10	1
Jane give it a try	1
Youre told to buy a lot and so in reality you want to buy all 230 yen cakes right	1
Do you all see that	1
Mm hmm	1
Am I really only doing 4 times 2	1
Its taken Were fine with you taking 15 minutes to go around the circle	1
So those are the two things that I really wanted you guys to do but did you have something else to tell us Logan	1
And we are just looking at this and we are sort of restricted to how  much room we have on this overhead arent we	1
Zeroone would be right here and then you needed to connect that okay	1
And then and then it might not  work unless there is something of three that first on the dark  green and that would be the red cause you can fit three	1
Zero point five	1
Bum bum bum	1
Choshi	1
Is he far enough away from the data to be considered weird	1
Raise your hand if you thought it was addition	1
Are you sure youre okay	1
Are you done	1
Go	1
Read it to me	1
What Adam	1
You re going to	1
Is it 10	1
Did you list the multiples did you list the factors	1
Are these correct	1
Kenna	1
Are you sure	1
Ian	1
I think it s six	1
This is two  thirds so then you have two more thirds left over	1
Blake do you have a shorter route	1
Questions on this page right now	1
Yes	1
What do you think Tanner do I have my complete sentence now	1
Okay so Im going back to and I am going to call on another personMia Turn your microphone on	1
Sure go for it	1
Youre cool okay	1
Isabelle	1
The five sixths one way and the two fifths the other way	1
Is this what you did for one twenty	1
Thats why we always said they had a positive slope because the positive number in front of X all right	1
Threefourths	1
So the question is can you go and do the sort of thing Mike did and write the box and triangle	1
Brian	1
So is that equal to onehalf	1
Talk to your shoulder partner	1
Clara	1
Anybody have any questions about any of that stuff	1
My brother my brother goes to Northland also	1
Excuse me	1
What	1
What number goes into each box right	1
Whos 17	1
He means this doesn t go up by two what s in between it goes up by two	1
Were doing an inquiry where youre going to figure this out and then I want you to go and explain how you did it and can you apply that rule to other things	1
You are changing your mind	1
What could your question be	1
Carolina	1
Go	1
Wow that s something to think about isn t it	1
What was that	1
Yes you can	1
Ready	1
How do you	1
You now realize	1
Okay so when were checking it what do we need to make sure we need to make sure this angle plus this angle equals 180 Right	1
Yeah	1
Whos to say whether that is twentyeight point five or twentyeight point six	1
So Larry had half of a fruit bar right	1
Yes	1
Three N means however many I buy I have to pay three dollars for right	1
Are these all the ones we had	1
Its like us adding a group plus a group plus a group plus a group right	1
Doubling the first coordinate will that work	1
And you get eightyone	1
Finding out the area of something	1
Who would like to share	1
Will we get answers	1
Instead of seven of these	1
Youre going to have three pizzas that you can make from each piece right	1
Mmmhmm	1
We have six thousand five hundred and sixty one yards um  meters of ribbon	1
You got 48	1
Okay somebody who thinks this years class is taller	1
Theo	1
Do you think Zoe was an outlier	1
Ok hw many  think you know the answer to that some of you have built a James	1
You good Max	1
You think five works	1
Brielle	1
Nine	1
I dont know	1
It was the X of zero right	1
She spent 23 of money on	1
A factor right	1
Stand up	1
Im going to give you another Yes	1
Austin	1
Yeah it doesnt matter	1
Yes sir	1
Is that a sentence I am a dog	1
Do guys want to do a number line or do you want to do a tape diagram	1
At 27	1
Ok and how many of you built more  than one model to show a solutions to that problem	1
nine is in the 1000th place and the other is in the 100th place and the 100th place is always higher than the 1000th place	1
Is it coming along	1
Did you want to respond	1
Oh yes	1
Uh is it done by you	1
Hey if you did not get an AP form back you got to give me five minutes into the class Ill get it to you okay	1
Because I have not taught you how to do my big numbers like this right	1
Oh raise your hand	1
Does anyone have a question to ask Alan about this	1
You did what	1
That means can we say that putting in 13 for X holds true for this inequality	1
Can I look at them both pieces	1
You want to hold your hand up Caitlin so  the rest of the class can see again	1
Can you go with that for me	1
When you know how to do multiplication its easier to do fractions when youre trying to find	1
Kate	1
Its going to be negative right	1
Okay Kelly which one are you looking at your eggs or milk or your candy	1
Repeated addition right	1
So hang on hang on Deneli let me stop you for just a sec does it matter more about the number of zeros or where the decimal is	1
So this is just a little bit less than a half right	1
You did Haven	1
Because they  the same	1
You can give me a thumbs up	1
Huh	1
Are you ready to share how you get that	1
Ok Did you hear what he said	1
We got four quarts right	1
Youre sure	1
Two were we missing a denominator on number five	1
Okay does 2x412	1
Adam do you know what youre doing buddy	1
Lapita  Im going to show yours	1
We need all the bathroom stuff right Stella	1
because Then as we can see here Do you guys remember this rule	1
Seventeen	1
You think you can	1
Its confusing right	1
Lionel	1
Sofia	1
See	1
Is that what you said	1
Can zero be doubled	1
What is it	1
Alice	1
Turn knee to knee and talk	1
Did I make two cuts	1
Thats better	1
And we can see how much he needs	1
I would say Im going to ask you to leave that and move on to the next  okay	1
Kameron	1
So if I said lets say lets count by fours if we were looking at a four by four array and we needed to figure out how many were in there we could count by fours right	1
How many of you  think it would be ok	1
The tenths place	1
So you think its an incomplete sentence because of that	1
Yes it was probably	1
Are they correct	1
The answers just 56 isnt it	1
You all have one of these	1
But should those relationships hold	1
So you think they would have 32 yards	1
Dennis	1
Do her ordered pairs model whats there	1
Steffi is it possible	1
There was the difference between the two and the three my friends okay	1
Gage go ahead	1
Did they spread out	1
Good job now youre going to get a straight edge and youre going to connect those two okay	1
Oh yeah now I remember	1
What did he say Zoe	1
What	1
You two are partners right	1
Any questions	1
Can you show me	1
Yeah Peter	1
One three four and five is what I need you working on you got it	1
Well I said you make the smallest one you can make	1
Do we know what the D is	1
Stella	1
Are you there Magnus	1
So you said you split them in half Yes	1
Ready to go on	1
Does 3000 makes sense	1
Its onefourth plus onefourth plus onefourth plus onefourth equals fourfourths right	1
So remember the other day when I did the estimate	1
Sakais one is also good isnt it	1
Good	1
Partial	1
I got 3 through 15 because	1
How are we doing	1
Micha	1
Sandra	1
Do you agree disagree or have a question about that one Juliet	1
Sarah	1
but do you know why	1
Gentlemen	1
Okay so thats the largest  Yeah	1
Can you	1
Fivefive	1
Does that make sense that its	1
Oh 1316	1
Do you want that divided sign here	1
We have talked about algorithms many times before right	1
One two three	1
Two times wider	1
Stephanie	1
I would like the person closest to the floor to go first	1
So you have two notebooks	1
Busted	1
James Ariel is writing this number three can  you write the other	1
Do you	1
Oh	1
This is three twelfths right	1
Yeah	1
Okay Brian and Jeff	1
Addison	1
Marcela	1
And I think it is much more Arnela listen for a second please	1
Well maybe if you say you had a white rod and you  divided the white rod maybe you could make more models  that way if you divided the white rods	1
Thats right	1
Ready	1
Those those two scores seem very high compared to the rest yes	1
Improper	1
All right makes sense	1
Transparent	1
Are all of those pieces equal	1
As I go across this thing and I m looking for legal x s are all of the x s allowed to be put into this function	1
Max	1
Yes	1
Are those equal	1
This ones quite a bit bigger right	1
Lacy	1
58 12	1
Ready to make this tricky	1
Should we try it	1
I just wanted two questions on this one because I got  this one I got really stumped on its same with this one	1
Would you please have both partners have number three done so that we can come around and check it before independent work okay	1
Could we multiply it by the first column	1
Okay any questions on how we connected these points to the graph and found the slope	1
Yes	1
Landon	1
One and 56	1
Were you able to do all five River	1
Could you fill this in if I gave you a blank one of these right now made it a quiz	1
For example one the reason why I think this is a cool connection is do we know very much about the triangle example one	1
Are you always the same number of years apart	1
Who said nine	1
Because sometimes I cant hear you so I dont know	1
Okay Paige	1
Put your hands up on your head when you are done	1
Does that make sense	1
Yeah	1
I think it gives you four because its basically two sixths combined so of each one gives you double amount	1
Are you all done talking	1
Some of the questions on how to interpret	1
Or is it closer to two	1
Did you think there might be more	1
The bottom	1
Y	1
taking the test you want to have that feeling now	1
Well you can find out what number goes into each box	1
can we still write that on our paper	1
Are you reading along with	1
You guys we did one one fifth of whole numbers yesterday right	1
Less than	1
Showdown	1
I got it right too	1
Kim	1
Can a half be a bigger half	1
Yes Abby	1
Okay any questions on this one	1
Landon	1
All right Charlie start us off	1
Youre already done	1
Or everyone can get something right right	1
Because there are four rows and we if talk about the first two rows  that s two fourths	1
You should two answers for C right	1
Who can type in the chat Say me  If you know what division is	1
Monday	1
Work with your table group	1
Charlie	1
2	1
Classidy class	1
So we can actually switch these around and say we have 18 24ths which is what three fourths is right	1
How many think they could  be a third and a half	1
No its not like	1
I think it would be good for us to do a couple more of this what do you guys think	1
Areesh	1
So Okay so Ill do Ill do the first eight hows that	1
When you got an answer please stand up	1
There would be a three where the one was and also a nine where the three was	1
Talk to your neighbor	1
Its sort of like the Cuisenaire Rods	1
Because whatever you do to the bottom you have to do to the top	1
Okay so three halves is going to be this would be the same as two halves right	1
I thought of that	1
Then you add em together and you get seventytwo out of two fortythree	1
Yes James	1
Questions	1
Michael	1
I think its going to be bigger	1
Ok so Im confused when you say carry the two youre not  carrying two of these	1
Can we do something like this	1
Charlie C	1
What	1
Yeah	1
What	1
Would I have to round this up	1
What	1
You can talk to me about that afterward okay	1
So its 50 and then one more fourth right	1
Have you heard the word	1
Thats thats simplifying is great then you can	1
Half	1
Is that right	1
No	1
Im just going to show you this way because you could have gone plus one That way too that makes sense	1
I think we dont have the top one see	1
Anybody online have any questions about these	1
Alright Bruce go	1
Why dont you read this to me	1
Closer to the one in the thousandths square	1
So if you think that the answer is one and Okay so how many of you do this if you think that the answer is three sixths or one half	1
Yes	1
Yes	1
You want to talk about it with your partner for a minute	1
To one whole so isnt it like multiplying the fraction by one	1
Im sorry	1
Go ahead um Jeff	1
Have you guys heard about that before	1
Is that really that	1
So guys theres a link to the Pear Deck in the chat if youre just getting Here are several links okay	1
Does anybody have any questions	1
So to input this X do I have to put this number	1
You fix ten which has thirtyfour right	1
If there are any extra after each basket has five you can add to the other baskets	1
With me so far	1
Okay well you can do a little mental calculation right	1
Two thirds	1
I think that after 110 its 26	1
There is something like this here right	1
Elijah	1
So  is there enough water for everyone	1
But you did nothing wrong did you	1
Yours were all lines as well	1
Are you asking when youre multiplying does the denominator get bigger	1
Penny	1
Eli	1
It was bigger by one one sixth	1
Remember when we did partial products we got a whole bunch of products that the answers to multiplication problems and then we have to add them all up to put them together	1
I think that theres maybe kind of a fraction way	1
Alexander	1
Brian	1
Yes whats your question	1
What does this say	1
No its not when you generally think about right	1
Is that allowed	1
Id love to hear from somebody in MathLand	1
Twos	1
You want to do it	1
Yes	1
A ribbon that  is a meter long	1
Oh really	1
You are in essence answering a different  question maybe	1
2000 is a lot of money but is it as big as it looks like on this graph	1
Improper	1
Yes Herve	1
Should X be seven	1
We only have a piece of it right	1
Can you hear me	1
Would the relationships that youre suppose to show change	1
Miss	1
The other one is sort of a what do you remember from Math III problem	1
Do these opened cells look like sailboats to you	1
Did you get it right Louie	1
Campbell did we hear from you last time	1
Another four no another four oranges to fit five more of the  browns on so it would be a yard long probably	1
You following me	1
Maybe instead of you doing Where did you	1
Yes we did	1
Okay so a number sentence to express that and then show or explain how you used the picture to solve the problem okay	1
Could we do this one	1
No	1
But you when youre doing your samples do you need to put more people than there are lockers	1
1212 minus 912	1
Are you done	1
Hold on one second to that did you have a hard time coming up with this	1
When we divide are we finding the size of the groups or the number of groups	1
Do you guys see how we did that	1
And then you multiplied it by 2 again right	1
Everybody knows what an easel looks like	1
Julia	1
Remember that	1
Clay	1
Any questions so far on anything we did for this one	1
People who are done writing okay	1
Daniel	1
Is this the screen you want me to leave it on	1
Guys know your identities okay	1
Michael you re doing thirty	1
Grenada	1
Umm cause if you did it like this	1
That sound good to everybody	1
London if I were to draw a picture would that help me	1
So four times four times four is four to the third power okay	1
Go ahead	1
Right Jessica	1
Then you divide it by three because it said triple and you go backwards and you get nine	1
We can do this side also right	1
If I start out with four  box can I subtract 25 from that	1
Did you do the math	1
So if 0 is important Id like you to tell me with thumbsup under your chin if 0 is not important show me with thumbsdown	1
Do we need another minute to look at that sixeighths or do we have that finished too	1
You guys ready	1
Are they equivalent	1
For slope we got to make some stairs right	1
Have we won	1
Anybody in here have the isosceles triangle one	1
Im done	1
How about you	1
Michael what one are you solving	1
Lennon	1
Is this one clear to you guys	1
And so are those so if we lay these on top of each other they would be exactly the same right	1
In do you still remember	1
Shes like hey I used addition and multiplication because I can multiply because this is counting by twos right	1
And I saw you you were writing things down werent you	1
So all it does is changes positions in the place value chart and it becomes either 10 times greater or a tenth less okay	1
Ms	1
So you multiplied by eight yup	1
Yes	1
You see what Im saying	1
You ready	1
Hum I need somebody else to say go	1
A hundred	1
Mr Blake	1
Mia	1
But does it stop it either one of my points	1
Are you going to show me on Friday that you have completed up to paragraph five	1
Do you still expeT2 that you would get the same answer	1
Do you have it all figured out	1
25	1
What question Can I clarify	1
No	1
Then for the common factor	1
Harold	1
Fair	1
Six	1
Okay and now five	1
Test for the lefthand side and righthand side okay	1
Tyler	1
As rides increase are we gaining more and more points left	1
Marie come on up	1
I see Meredith is wanting to say something	1
So can your rule work at all	1
How do I feel	1
Any questions on number one or number two for our warmups for today	1
Mikala	1
Argo	1
Do you see how that wouldnt work	1
Yes thats my point	1
Missy	1
Do we know the area	1
When it says every other tenth and one it adds a zero every time to the decimal	1
Four twenty divided by 12	1
does that make sense	1
Ezra	1
Could I have counted by fives	1
Remember I said I would steal your money Ill give you four you give me 40	1
You said it was less	1
What is it	1
Yes	1
Negative	1
It was with the coordinates grid	1
How about this one	1
Student number three stand up	1
Okay read for me the definition of a pyramid	1
Caleb	1
Hugh can you repeat that	1
What	1
Are you becoming a factoring master	1
Anna	1
It could be either way	1
I hear you saying that because 17 is an odd number youre thinking youll have to use a fraction or a decimal	1
Who would like to be my next Ms Koski	1
This is okay	1
Is this the problem were working on	1
Okay I put 18 teaspoon in each batch right	1
Very weird	1
Is there some X which will permit you to say whatever X you chose you will have two equals minus two	1
Chloe	1
Yes	1
I should hear talking amongst you and your partner	1
Gavin	1
Three so our third person so what were essentially doing in this problem is multiples right	1
Hunter	1
You need to talk why dont you come around and talk to me for a second	1
Does anybody need to have that shown  what they wouldve done	1
Clay	1
Are you writing down what you are doing though	1
Hundredths	1
We did	1
So youve got to decide what how what you need for the minimum number of steps for your triangle all right	1
You can just tell me one two	1
Purple	1
And if you look at that first problem right there on page 13 thats the one I just gave you about Terrell and hes a competitive stair climber right	1
Five wholes	1
How many have two models	1
Pardon	1
Juliana did you have a question	1
One	1
Light green	1
common denominator	1
Go ahead	1
It becomes 1 and 36	1
Twentyfive to one dividing them both now wait a second youre dividing them both by four arent you	1
What do you  think	1
Faye	1
So like if the decimal when its like two or one lets just say that was	1
Landon	1
Thats a big number	1
Are you confident	1
Or y intercept up here	1
The common multiple	1
Who is going to reiterate what Dan said	1
If group B ate 56 of it could group A eat 23	1
12 plus 48 so did you guy get that	1
Yea	1
Ashley	1
Yes	1
Okay now I have 1 2 and 3 fourths right	1
Just in this picture does it tell us the lines are parallel	1
That length is one third but when you place your  numbers on the number line can you write them all as one  third	1
Yes	1
Take a moment to talk at your group	1
Did you have a question Duke	1
Can you answer me	1
Is it eight away there	1
So youd have to put A cubed plus B cubed	1
The one hundred times four	1
Bruce will you read the instructions	1
You two need to share	1
You got the logical reasoning there	1
So raising your hands or give me a thumbs up	1
Oh youre waiting for me because were done over here	1
Im going to ask Michael	1
That sound good everyone	1
Is anybody still writing down this problem	1
Anybody want to bet me	1
Are you ready	1
Remember	1
16 no zeros right	1
No	1
58 12	1
Did anybody solve this using an algorithm	1
Yeah	1
An odd numbered tower	1
Ok um well um we had this model and we uh this is two  thirds and three fourths and we think that three fourths is  bigger by one twelfth	1
Hey are we talking about this or are we just doing this	1
Are we did I tell you to plus	1
So I put	1
Brandon	1
A who would like to read A	1
2	1
Yes zero right	1
Separate the 30 from the five and put 30	1
Yes its equivalent to 13 right Emily	1
Some people got low scores but most people but some people could do everything	1
Willem	1
Is there any groups that have found it	1
Go ahead	1
Are you willing to try something different	1
Turn and talk to your shoulder partner	1
Jessica	1
Does the new trapezoid look the way you expect it	1
Then I became easy and I shaded it all and then I double shaded this part	1
What do you think	1
Youre finding you have to first find one right	1
I think I did most of it right but the thing got stuck on is 10 times the number but 10 times plus five plus 90	1
Yes	1
Can I see a raised hands	1
The I Your I is only this one isnt it	1
A way to partition it	1
Yeah	1
I did 7 x 3 is 21 and then 8	1
Were reRamona close right	1
Are dogs pets	1
Addition problem	1
You got the red one	1
I say we go	1
Maruyas was also an inequality equation right	1
Everybody agree	1
Are you sure the median is 105	1
Stand up if youre a two	1
Madison	1
The number of  side by  to find out what	1
Lets listen to what David has to say	1
Im getting 5852 does that work for everyone	1
Everyone have that so far	1
Rafael	1
Youre multiplying by more than 1 right	1
Okay the 3 times 15 does it equal 15	1
What	1
Does anybody agree with me	1
Please stand when you are done	1
Did anybody get it wrong	1
It is almost the same as the one you got here right	1
Well we have fortyeight whites going up to one here dont we	1
That the factors are bigger when taking two thirds of two thirds	1
Three people in here can make any sense of that	1
You would put it under the zero	1
Jose say that louder	1
Jitka	1
Stand up when youre done	1
And you know what six factorial is right	1
Somebody read for me the fraction	1
Can you hang onto that question for just a little bit	1
Meredith you were going to say something earlier	1
Is that legal	1
Can you listen	1
But is that smaller than that	1
You like  that	1
Okay are you sure	1
How many think one third	1
Can you say what Lucilles table just did in your own words	1
They are working on 112 of 334 Im correct	1
Oh okay	1
Is this one greater than 45 times nine	1
Turn and talk to your kneetoknee partner about these two rules	1
Does it matter with the side of this	1
Stand up when you are done	1
Is it just this side where we can do it	1
I automatically know that I can write the twenty right	1
I was three off at my first guess	1
Ms Reeves	1
so I dont want to multiply the denominator  the numerator  and I got 70	1
Cooper	1
Two	1
Call on someone to help you	1
Victoria	1
Im going to give you some clues okay	1
Do it the same way over here okay	1
Did I change the size of my pieces	1
Anybody who used pictures	1
Jessie	1
Yeah	1
Can I have a friend read that out loud Julia can you please read it	1
Yeah Herve	1
I want you to say as a team two intelligent things that you can say about how those two things compare all right	1
Georgia makes sense	1
Is it this	1
How far where are you	1
Kimberly	1
Raise your hand if you believe that equals one whole	1
Then Ill draw it for you so okay	1
You made squares	1
If three teaspoons equals one batch we want to know what two batches would make right	1
So you  in the cases where you actually sort of got in and had to do the calculations had to sort of slog through the calculations in one way or another youre treating the last game as special and then youre looking at the possibilities that could lead up to it is that fair	1
Remember were just shooting some baskets are throwing some passes right	1
You know the tower problem	1
Let us hear what Meredith has to say	1
Are you following me	1
Can I get 6 into 19	1
Is four a square number	1
Hum	1
See how it starts to get a little crooked	1
So when we are adding we always add place value the same place values together right	1
Margo	1
And one times two would be two right	1
All right	1
Because you also called it one half  didnt you you and Meredith	1
Not really	1
equal a thing	1
Could we multiply by anything	1
Pardon	1
Yes will the product be greater than nine Georgia	1
Here	1
Talk to your neighbors ab or talk to your shoulder partner	1
We talked a lot last week about You need to be paying attention right	1
Yes	1
Okay so you were at the post office	1
Ariana	1
Do you know them	1
Is that alright	1
Well unfortunately we dont yet because can we use both addition and subtraction to make a six into a 12	1
Now because that would be two hundred twenty three times three okay	1
So think of the examples that we just used parts of a set or parts of a whole	1
Eileen	1
Max	1
You guys feeling okay about that one	1
Carey	1
You think six	1
Thats good huh	1
Sydney	1
Tim	1
15 hats for 60	1
Ok but she didnt combine them and shes calling the two  whites together again Meredith	1
Now Ive guessed and theyre going to tell me how far away am I	1
Thats an improper	1
Eight plus one	1
Draw another circle	1
Thats good huh	1
So here is your number line and we have a zero okay	1
Dark blue	1
We watch this for the example	1
Can I stop you there for just a minute	1
Remember how we talked about a half and the whole	1
Mmhmm	1
Yes	1
Did you guys get it	1
If you doubled that it would be sixteen oranges  and  sixteen oranges and four browns	1
Now youre saying youre being left behind here a little bit	1
Chloe can I do two minus nine	1
questions so far	1
Anybody have 14	1
Nice and loud so we can all hear	1
Five	1
No	1
So if I have eight five and five I could have I could make eight plus five over five which would be 13 over five right	1
Bennett	1
Do I expect you all to be pros at it	1
Pam pararampam	1
Im like you know what	1
Twentyseven	1
The second one	1
Florian	1
And you had to think about whether to shade to the right or the left right	1
And the two 50s	1
So super duper easy	1
Are you done	1
Do these two still have anything in common	1
Graham	1
Would I do it that way	1
Fletcher	1
Pardon	1
Remember that Erik	1
Up to the second day this one has mor had more right	1
Tell me why I can do all this stuff from all the  units but my test	1
Can I take from here	1
Yes Bruce	1
And  then for twos  two four six eight ten and it  would go on and be more than ten	1
Two thirds of it	1
What I did kind of was I had two sixths I had two thirds	1
Any other answers before we talk about this problem	1
Whats the	1
But you couldve just timesed this by 2 and you wouldve  had it a lot easier than going times times times	1
Hudson	1
The five tells us how many pieces we need to make one	1
Are they equal to each  other	1
All right Ashley	1
Oh you know what	1
three is three more than three and a half	1
Six	1
Yes	1
so yes yeah	1
Yes	1
You could call you can call the dark green one six the  dark green rod six and then you could call the light green rod three	1
Oh don t confuse me now	1
Twentysix and four	1
Judith you know how to start right	1
Okay perhaps you can share that with  the children in your group	1
Camilla	1
Are you saying you multiplied here	1
Ella did	1
Make sense	1
Yes and we can explain it right	1
Does that actually double it	1
Asher	1
And go	1
Does that  make sense	1
Okay classy classy	1
Vicki	1
Times three	1
Those of you who did not have answer two for your final answer do you now understand it	1
Mine is 1200	1
Who thinks that their class was taller on average	1
Yes	1
It has to be a different number	1
Can I summarize what you said	1
it would be eighttwelfths	1
Jahari nice and loud	1
How many of you think the answer is yes	1
And how did you do it to convince yourself uh  yes	1
Are you listening	1
Does that make any sense	1
This one	1
Yes do you	1
Okay you just know counting by seven	1
Things like these dr are also the same right	1
Are there any other questions on this	1
Did you guys decide yet or are you still discussing it	1
Any questions on that	1
See how Ive done it	1
Matty	1
That would mean each meter  gets three parts so you multiply this by three and I get a  hundred and fifty so thats how many bows you can get	1
Is this a square number	1
It is the same thing	1
Ready	1
Jarka	1
A factor	1
That s easy	1
Do you think this will solve our problem	1
The fact that you can get one on this side means that then if we extend it a little like this then huh	1
One right	1
Let me see if this is	1
Do you	1
What did I say Roman	1
Kennedy	1
I was able to make a hexagon into a triangle	1
Hudson	1
Diego	1
Yes	1
All right the grid paper All right you know what	1
You see	1
And then tell me what youre doing okay	1
Isaiah	1
Lacey	1
Any volunteers	1
Youre working on it with your table	1
Tate lets start with you	1
This side	1
The way you did it was easier wasnt it	1
Im keeping you here because what do you need	1
Do you want to go this one	1
Two	1
If I didnt know what a one half dozen was could I figure out just by looking at the picture	1
Angela	1
Yes	1
Two X minus two X is zero okay	1
could you do that	1
Coin flip	1
So basically we have Now you guys have been doing this forever right	1
You can we just	1
Of those of you standing did you get 3 for the first answer	1
I could count them out right	1
Gloria	1
You just finished	1
Ready	1
What does it say	1
Ready to try another one	1
Six frogs	1
Do you think it will get taller or wider in that boat in that new shape	1
Or did you just count	1
Wave to me right now if you are the writer for number three	1
If I gave you a picture of a graph would you be able to answer the question what is the domain of that graph	1
By 2000	1
Yes go ahead	1
Lisa	1
Zachs helping us	1
Ariana	1
Yes whats your question	1
Does anyone want to share their thoughts	1
Thirtyfive	1
Go	1
Again similar to how you write domain you would say that is all x s that are  0 or all the x s that are between three and five that would be 3  x  5 like that right	1
Do you remember our valueordered bar graphs	1
Do we have everything we need to find radius Or to find surface area	1
Iits just fractions but Im trying to have them in between  You know what I mean	1
So youre at two now	1
If you cut it like this then here with this one diagonal line would you get a triangle just over here	1
Yes its	1
Are you ready so you switch pairs today	1
Do we have any questions before you started	1
Im going to take the six again 60 again and then multiply it by five	1
No	1
What	1
Length	1
Hugh	1
I can do it in some of them but then I get too big and it totally floors me okay	1
Maddy I think you were next	1
No	1
Can I show people how you did that with the ratio table	1
To find your balance you would subtract what you spend right Nessa	1
Okay Shilo	1
I cant do it even with this	1
Would it be outside the building	1
Were really good at getting our ordered pairs on the graph but is it important what order you put them in	1
What	1
Did I mess that up	1
Last years minimum height was smaller than this years minimum height	1
Is that correct	1
No we can do this one again can we	1
Get it yet	1
Is that  alright	1
Five	1
We have square numbers 1 4 9 16 25 36 49	1
Yeah	1
Go ahead	1
You got something like this right	1
Hi Mr Oliver	1
And that is what five	1
After you analyzed your data a little bit more do you still feel like 1 is your typical value	1
Michelle	1
Um one	1
We had to multiply by three right	1
How many of you have ever used a number line before	1
for six	1
So you are saying for eight you got how many a ladder of two has eight is that what you are saying	1
What about you guys	1
So Meredith is still saying that I dont disagree with  you when I say that its a red bigger in this model  right	1
Do we know how much we were willing to pay yet	1
Are you partnering	1
John Adrian please do the warmup okay	1
Sure  whats up	1
Yes Zach	1
Five	1
Two people	1
I would like you to discuss it with your partner	1
Did you read what multiples are	1
Ready	1
You think that might be	1
Yeah go ahead	1
Would you know that that has the exact same X and Y values just the X is negative and the Y is positive	1
Does that make sense now	1
One sixth	1
Could I do 14 times 44	1
Margo	1
The Readers Digest version	1
inauidble Is 11 fourths the exact same as 2 and 34ths	1
What	1
Alan	1
I think its like two thirds right	1
Leo	1
I think I heard  you saying that if you took this blue ribbon and again  imagined it as two white ribbons is that what you said when  you said I m going to divide it in half right ok	1
This number has to be the same this letter has to be the same when Im doing it as a multiplication problem only mistake you made okay	1
Call up the next person Alenka	1
Did I say fraction	1
Yeah	1
How many of you know where I got the  one	1
Yeah	1
Identity	1
Sixsixth is equal to one right	1
Um	1
Huh	1
Remember no repeats	1
Raise your hand if  youve worked on that problem	1
Horizontal	1
This one	1
Stella	1
So Dakota can I can I say what you just said in the chat	1
Erik	1
So can I break it into three	1
Andrea	1
Caleb	1
Threefourths is bigger	1
If we say that if we ask what the answer is okay	1
Next okay	1
Were going to count	1
What was that	1
Can you add and subtract denominators	1
Because I can throw two more in there cant I	1
Cuz I just doubled it	1
It seems to me we have some differences  here dont we	1
Okay you havent done You did that in your head huh	1
Anybody	1
You guys for sailboat three when youre ready to go on you can talk to a friend about what the instructions are	1
I got 4056	1
Lauren	1
You hear that at the store right	1
People who are done with group ones	1
Group B ate this much right	1
Ariana	1
Six	1
Did you write down the formula	1
Makes sense	1
Isabelle	1
Sounds familiar	1
So if he spent twothirds of his allowance on comic books would that be a multiplication problem	1
Is it Brendan	1
Does anybody recognize where this comes from	1
That would be 54 right	1
Yesterday we should have stopped on 22 right	1
At 26	1
1x  9  2	1
So Frankie can I ask you a followup question	1
Do you see how once we got to 15 we did it two different ways	1
I was thinking about this model because we were talking about  models the other day werent we	1
So is this right or wrong	1
Do I care if you do it by multiplying or dividing	1
Go ahead	1
And now this is a ladder with  two right	1
Anyone done with number four on the back  right here	1
Can you do it correctly and what mistakes do you make	1
Now were going to start to take things further okay	1
So everybody agree we have two sets of equal sides	1
It shows the increase of the average house pricing from 1998 to 1999	1
All right so the first one was pretty easy right	1
Yes maam	1
No	1
Lauren	1
So thats the difference	1
You dont think	1
George	1
If I know that the surface area of the large square is 169 can I say something about how long this sloped side is	1
Diego	1
Do you know how to find mode	1
Kelly which one are you looking at	1
Can someone repeat what Amarilla said	1
Questions on this one	1
Whos lucky	1
Do you see what were doing	1
Yes	1
Yeah	1
Yes	1
Because its being divided by two so thats only half to 798212	1
What other questions do you have	1
Faith	1
Thats what I want you to write up there okay	1
Say I dont know I need more information	1
Okay so can a fifth work	1
Class	1
A difference of two sixths	1
Just can I clarify	1
Do you think we only subtract the numerator and not the denominator	1
It s the only way you could  show it there isn t it	1
Does anyone have any questions about why that was the answer	1
Do you need the pattern	1
Well please come up	1
I got five cups	1
Any thoughts any questions	1
Like kind of break it down and find it out	1
Yes	1
Christine	1
Can you continue	1
Repeat your question	1
Youre pretty much guaranteed that stuff is going to cancel right	1
Put up your hand	1
A division problem	1
Okay so you used this guy	1
23 of 8	1
And then and then yeah exactly	1
Make 12 your over Yes 12 okay	1
Did they have the original coordinates in that response	1
If Does that make sense	1
Did they enlarge it	1
Landon went good	1
Are they the same size	1
Thirteen yellows	1
Andulka	1
Owen	1
Thank you	1
Do you have any questions about the problem	1
You replace the X by a three and then what does it say	1
30 miles 30 feet	1
Questions comments or concerns	1
What does it say	1
And you both have this am I right	1
It looks like a much more complex problem though right	1
May I help you	1
Did you get it	1
So you see how I got my five one	1
Thumbs up if youre like Yeah one times 12 is 12	1
Do they	1
Was it something like a mathematical expression	1
Just everything	1
A lot	1
Rob	1
Did you have questions	1
The what	1
So it depends on what youre talking about as the whole right	1
No	1
A plot goes that way	1
You go backwards X up X to get to H Anybody online have questions on that one	1
Turn and talk to your neighbor	1
Am I right	1
So it tells me when I posed the question to you the first time it was very easy to figure out right	1
Julia	1
Light green	1
Connor do you have a question	1
Okay any questions on these points	1
The picture there	1
Okay now you guys ready	1
Yes	1
Remember how one little step can mess this up	1
Do you all understand that	1
Yep	1
Somebody say the secret again to make sure we all agree on what it is	1
Yes	1
They put them in this offertory box right	1
If I ask you to factor this quartic is that part of this unit	1
Yes	1
Yes	1
What else can I answer for you guys	1
it relates to because you basically multiply a whole which is equal to one so	1
Has anybody looked at the numbers yet	1
Chiba is it okay with it around here	1
Figure it out with your partner	1
Could you still figure out they were fourths even if you had 10 of them	1
Yes its easier to get the percents when you have a 100 as the denominator as the per per 100 so we are trying to go there and did you do like the quickest jump	1
Fabian	1
Okay I couldnt remember off the top of my head if that was right	1
How  many of your heard what Jackie said	1
Jitko	1
A little more over here	1
So on our little guy the quart is the arm right	1
Charlie	1
Okay heres my  rule you ready for it	1
So one whole one plus one sixth equals one and one sixth or 7 sixths	1
and 3 inches each	1
Talk to your table group	1
So I have my stacky cubes here okay	1
Do you	1
or do you have diagrams that you want to include	1
Fair enough	1
Weve just proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the only numbers of lockers that will be opened are the ones that have an odd number of factors right	1
Is that a complete sentence	1
Is that a straight line	1
Its really close to 200 isnt it	1
Are we ready to go over the problem	1
Or does it work	1
Are they identities	1
Emanual	1
The first problem that we had to do was if we had three  meters	1
Multiplicative identity property	1
You were	1
Yes	1
Would I be looking at  one of these ribbons	1
Did I get an area	1
Okay Zach go ahead	1
Anna	1
Okay are there any questions about these review sheets	1
If you believe this orangutan is taller than a fifth grader stand	1
I saw nine	1
You took a whole out and added it back in	1
Any problems so far	1
That clue leftover	1
Threeninths right	1
Do you agree that five tenths is the same as one half	1
Or do you want to do how much orange juice per soda water	1
So like split split all of them into like like one half or something like that	1
Ramona	1
How many pieces we actually have right	1
Huh	1
Yes Gavin	1
Yes	1
Are these the same	1
Four minus four plus negative four is equal to zero right	1
Did we use an area model yesterday	1
For real you guys ready this time	1
So if we look right here we knew that Julia read 8 books right	1
Will you show your answer quickly	1
Yeah Sterling	1
How do we do  like that	1
One out of four or onefourth okay	1
Fiona	1
Addend remember she talked about that	1
However is it possible is it possible if I were talking about  different candy bars	1
Carrie	1
Did anybody draw a picture	1
Is that true for here	1
Clay	1
You see	1
So in the previous activity you calculated the typical height of a fifth grader right	1
Elaine	1
When we have four dots on a dice it usually looks like that okay	1
Is it closer to a whole	1
Talk	1
Wallace and Walter tell me what Harriette just said	1
Now if we think about base ten blockswhat were talking about is the difference in these correct	1
Okay	1
Cuz there would be well cuz there would be forty eight whites equal up to one and then	1
Why can t it one	1
Yes sir	1
Annelies and Myselle	1
If youre in a city does it matter which way you go	1
Okay Kate turn yours on please	1
Make sure every single question is how you liked it	1
Laura	1
Fingers on the nose of people that have a noticing	1
Is the answer correct	1
The three and seven is switched	1
Do you want to count with me up here	1
Are you ready to share	1
1 is a factor two is a factor four is a factor five is a factor	1
Are there any questions about that	1
So what we did is me and Dean here divided the  by the numerator in the rule	1
Is it not working out	1
Remember	1
Like this	1
For all of you	1
Frankie whos your partner	1
Quentin	1
Michelle	1
We cant use something we dont have guys okay	1
Is there anything else you want to say about  that	1
One block if you have nine blocks and each of them takes one block that would be nine pizzas right	1
Its memorized	1
Like this	1
Questions	1
Roger	1
Ok this is two meters right	1
12	1
Rory	1
Lets look whats our next color	1
Does that make sense	1
Umhum	1
Are you ready	1
Neil are we doing okay	1
So I know that I cant multiply it by 15 times six to get the closest to 82 can I	1
Four	1
Yeah Adeline	1
So let s do a little bit more please because  let backtrack a bit do you mind	1
That would be the perfect explanation for how you would explain multiplying fractions using an area model right Finn	1
With the white ribbon	1
Done	1
Are you guys thinking about that	1
So remember what we did	1
Yes	1
How many of you followed  what David said	1
Another one	1
Yes	1
Matteo	1
What was that Sean	1
3	1
So you did six times two	1
Remy you got this buddy	1
Am I correct	1
Is that why you do it Clay	1
Go	1
Yeah its a turn around batch right	1
Adriana go for it	1
Yes Cassie	1
Thats what I got	1
Yeah	1
And are you labeling	1
We found one way over here we found this way it seems to  me  there ought to be something in between is that what  you re thinking	1
Why not	1
We are measuring fifth graders all right	1
Yes	1
Kind of	1
So I would draw a stick and so there are four wholes right	1
Is that a route to the school	1
Thats it	1
Okay now if you didn t want it to collapse right	1
How do we use how we use the slope formula or what the steps are	1
Do you see what Im doing here	1
Okay so its more of the writing part that doesnt make sense to you its explaining what the rule is	1
Yes	1
What are you saying	1
Yes	1
Hmmmm	1
Who can repeat what Natasha just said	1
What bothers you and then maybe the people here  will try to help ok	1
Katie did you get that one	1
Five right	1
Ariana	1
How many of you would say fist to five five being This made perfect sense to I was a little confused zero Friend I have no idea what this was even asking me	1
London	1
Its invisible okay	1
Who just said Wait what	1
Okay can I ask a question	1
You know how to do this correctly	1
You think you got it	1
Kiera	1
Talk with your table groups	1
Are those all the same	1
Im confused how do we match these	1
The same amounts	1
because its	1
Those are clue words right	1
Shut up	1
You all could imagine that can t you	1
Thousandths	1
Three	1
I want Lucy to start out I really think you need to do four times 12 because we need to find out how many eggs shes buying in a month right	1
Cooper	1
Does that make the number close to this	1
Oh thats the eight right	1
Tall	1
No if we trade it for a no lets trade it for a blue	1
Is it	1
I thought that it would be nine	1
Alan	1
Youre done right	1
Oh no youre raising your hand	1
And did it stop it from being this long doing 10	1
Oh oh I know	1
T	1
Yeah two	1
Would that be best representing our data	1
2x equals 76	1
Its your turn now Bs	1
This combination would be to this  There should be out of part of these out of these ten	1
If you can would you raise your hand	1
Start talking	1
Yes	1
Excuse me	1
What	1
And 12 dont fit because 15 dont fit into a 12 do they	1
Arthur	1
Did we have to find a common denominator when multiplying up here	1
OK is everybody happy with that	1
Eliza	1
I divided and	1
Yes	1
Everybody say Decompose	1
Is   that sort of alright	1
No	1
Jackie	1
We cant do it because it doesnt have more pieces	1
Okay Miss Genevieve	1
We did six times 20	1
Part of that is doing it correctly right	1
Got it	1
Ashley	1
From group number five	1
Your Xvalue tells you the sidetoside movement okay	1
What is it	1
Hm	1
Is this the length of my shape	1
Can can you get it	1
Those two	1
Now did you know that 17 x five was 85	1
Bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump	1
Its commutative	1
Thats exactly what your question says correct	1
Kelly were you going to say something	1
Alright so if this is two   then this would be a half because if you put another one and  another one that d be two	1
Haven	1
No	1
Oh did you guys hear that	1
Cooper	1
Vicki	1
Well I said you make the smallest one you can make	1
Yeah that makes more sense right	1
That number is bigger than six	1
Teacher	1
Can I just say okay three times two equals six and zero times five equals zero	1
Are you guys working together	1
Any questions about that first page	1
Four right	1
Inequality equation	1
Okay so 4 twos would be half	1
Michelle	1
Beth	1
All right  Ready	1
Whatever way youre thinking about it the important  thing is can you do a different problem and work it out  with these ways	1
Thats why although it may be tedious for the applied problems of inequality equations okay	1
or do you like both ways	1
Do you  all see that	1
But really did they get a full mile	1
Would you expect it to work if your	1
Take another one	1
Yeah	1
How many of you want to know	1
Heres a third but then I need to divide that into two parts right	1
Five	1
Anybody else	1
Okay everybody got that	1
Yes Abby	1
Talk as your table	1
So the 55000 would actually be the answer so it would have been better left out of the question wouldnt it	1
Yes sir	1
And I think thats what you were doing earlier right	1
Can I  another	1
Is that what youre telling me	1
All right lets share all that weve got	1
Show me on your fingers	1
Your job right now is All right everybody read this together	1
I want you to talk to your shoulder partner about what you understand the problem is before you get started	1
Yes	1
Everybody show me on your fingers what number are you working on	1
Yes	1
Its in the ones place right	1
Have you guys talked about it	1
It looks like its right in the middle right	1
Erik did you want to say  something	1
Remember youre going to use a letter for your answer okay	1
Danielle	1
If I said right now I went around and did this and I said  Celeste whats your favorite color	1
So if I split what I have left If I split these even like this am I going to be able to give equal parts to the rest of the people	1
How many of you think its  going to be smaller	1
So they didnt do both of them right	1
Wait times two bigger	1
So I have two thirds times one fourth so right	1
Is that it	1
Okay now am I done	1
If you ve got it write it down and come show it to me would you	1
Ooh Donna can I do rectangles	1
So you put them down you plotted wrong basically right	1
Then I see youve got four columns and six rows	1
What	1
Onefourth	1
Do you see the ordered pairs in the speech bubble there	1
It works	1
Can you do it without using lines and line segments or rays	1
so five one which you already plotted Right	1
Yes	1
Remember our objective is common denominators and models today okay	1
Do you want to pull back your argument and listen to other  people s	1
Classy classy	1
How many of you thought this was a fun activity	1
I could do it	1
Okay if I have 183 meter pieces of yarn is that correct	1
Subtract	1
What	1
Because  uh um	1
Dr Maher what I think is since Alan says you should have two fourths here and two fourths here but each time you have a whole you have to have four fourths for each whole	1
Royce	1
It equals more than full and it equals	1
Finished	1
Its easy right	1
The decimal place will move	1
Raise your hand	1
Whats the issue over here	1
Because theyre not quite fully to whats really happening in it okay	1
Want to see what you know	1
Steven	1
Youve got to split the whole into fourths this time okay	1
It happens to be an eight by eight classroom	1
Did we double	1
Understand	1
How many of you believe that it should go to the left of threethirds	1
Eric	1
Partial quotients	1
And Im getting smaller to bigger right	1
All right that sound good everybody	1
You just said that what I did was I took a whole Kleenex and I cut it in two pieces and if I have one its 12 right	1
Yeah range would mean ys right	1
Anybody else	1
Julie youre doing a great job but please listen okay	1
Twelve over twelve	1
How many of you can imagine in your  heads	1
Then  the five left if you divided them up into fives it would be five ten  fifteen twenty twenty five so each person would get one and one  fifth	1
Could I take the fish  in Danielles model the little fish in Danielle model and  swap it or lets take Audras big fish can I put it in Danielles  little box	1
Is this helping everybody	1
Anybody else	1
Jana	1
Right substitute it back into the equation right	1
What	1
Ready	1
Dwayne you want to do it	1
What	1
My pleasure just one after the other Ill write it down afterwards okay	1
Roy	1
Should it be zero	1
Trapezoid	1
You got it	1
We we	1
Yes	1
All right everybody got that one	1
If I multiplied three by two I get six right	1
No	1
Did everybody hear that	1
Savannah	1
Zero and four hundredths	1
Half of that	1
And then the wrist theres two of them in the wrist right	1
alright all right someone online	1
Do you have a question	1
Now now look at the first problem see the first  problem	1
Just like in a different position	1
Yes	1
So if we do nine times twothirds are we going to get a product that is greater than nine	1
Everybody say Addend	1
Yes	1
Who is that	1
How many of you think the answer is greater than	1
You mean theyre right up next to each other	1
Two	1
Go	1
How many of you worked out which is bigger	1
Say that again Denver	1
Will you call in someone else	1
Are you ready	1
Well yeah but you should be writing  paper right	1
You put it in a table	1
E Two X and three in the back doesnt that work out	1
Give me a thumbs up if you feel confident with the multiple skipcounting strategy	1
Questions about that	1
Does is anyone else stuck on 567	1
Sonia are you feeling confident	1
Explain that again	1
That was three	1
Do I have as many cabinets on this side	1
I would like to take your grade on this okay	1
Baking	1
Go ahead	1
The coordinates okay	1
Do you need a zero	1
Yeah it gets kind of crowded sometimes doesnt it	1
And  then that would be one sixth too	1
Hudson you ready	1
Louie	1
In all he uses 9 cups of the two ingrdients	1
Using thirty white rods to call one	1
Yes she put an 80	1
Zeros my first line right	1
OK whoever s going to talk needs the mike who s talking	1
Twentyone means that two times	1
Zoey did you get something	1
Even though we know its going to be 10 we can find it on an area model by shading in	1
Now I need to represent my 25 right	1
Is that what youre saying	1
Do we know our combinations	1
Now you guys told me that our tenths have the exact same amount of lines on them so can I count my tenths exactly like I did my fifths	1
Wont it extend to this side	1
Would everybody agree	1
So I want you each to try what you came up with and then I want a complete answer when you tell okay	1
Do you want to say it to the camera	1
No I was asking the same thing as she did but I heard you explain it	1
Nine total	1
We said we were giving her half the  candy bar didn t we	1
Remember what you guys were talking about that you explained to me	1
Does that make sense	1
Theyre both division right	1
Can you guys do this	1
Yeah Xavier	1
Okay Evan	1
This is the same as 3  2 over 4  3 to get 612 right	1
We could skip count by sevens if we wanted to right	1
Ellie will you read that for us please	1
Alright any questions on that one	1
Yes	1
Andrew	1
Talk to your neighbor	1
But there are a lot more equal than this right	1
Whats going on	1
Right here	1
This is also an equivalent fraction and its multiplicative identity property	1
Yes Kyle	1
Two squares one on top of each other right	1
No the one where you have to borrow okay	1
You gotta have both parts right	1
Six	1
Hows that sound	1
You were able to get one	1
Feeling okay about this one everybody	1
Because youre all	1
So Haley jumped up and said Oh well the dimensions of the shaded are its two thirds here and two thirds here do you understand why you couldnt write one third one third one third one third	1
Bom ba da bom bom	1
You see what I did	1
River	1
You  know what	1
Five	1
You have four greens  and you have three purples its just that here you have is it really  different though	1
Doing them backwards isnt as bad as not doing them at all right	1
I	1
Rebecca	1
Okay sound good everybody	1
You mean the sum of seven	1
Is that  right	1
But Ive taught it already Jessica	1
Y is minus twoandahalf X minus twoandahalf X and the starting number is	1
Amanda	1
Slim	1
Is that right	1
You all know that	1
For this problem	1
Did your table group talk about anything Franc	1
So I want to say that Can I say that out louder guys	1
So we would have to keep going to extend that to see if it works right	1
Okay who do I see doing a great job	1
Less than would be the same as greater than	1
If it is zero then there is no B right	1
Its an activity of Whats that	1
Is that kind of what you explained at the bottom	1
Then you still have to add that page right	1
You have 12 pencils and nine colored pencils	1
Kamora	1
Alan what were you going to say	1
This is only for problems that are just single digit by single digit other than zeros does that make sense	1
Did I have to count boxes	1
Its hard isnt it	1
How many of you think we can	1
What question would you like to ask me	1
Always	1
Tera	1
I put one and one half there	1
Gosh  thats not going to work right	1
There s actually more than one way to write it but   Abir	1
Myrte	1
Do your rules sound like that one	1
More	1
Seven hundred fifty	1
I am nice	1
Luke	1
So eg is the same as f h Okay	1
Yeah	1
Were you	1
Did you guys understand that	1
Okay so do you know the order that you do the	1
Yeah you know what I like about coordinates too Maddy	1
So you will know you are successful if you can solve two multiplication problems on page 48 using US traditional method using the US traditional method okay	1
Matthew	1
Whats up	1
I feel good about it I just kind of am confused on how you get the final answer the bottom one and the top one	1
And then in a minute you will also did you succeed with 15	1
Go	1
Bianca	1
Could you build  it on your desk and believe it	1
Anybody online have any questions so far	1
Numbers up to four	1
down the answer please stand	1
Everybody	1
Okay wave at me if youre writing	1
Remember	1
Okay any questions on that	1
Audra	1
Youve chosen to make your other  principal players in relationship to that one right	1
Also whenever youre baking	1
So these are ones that you just want to make sure that theyre not a guess right	1
But he has this and you have this am I right	1
Four factors right	1
What does that say	1
Can this one be Hector right here	1
And make your partner convince you and then you switch  roles then your partner has to make up a problem and ask  you right	1
sine	1
Okay Does that sound good so far	1
Do they look equal	1
How is it	1
Ready	1
So does it make sense	1
Is this a special right triangle at all	1
Okay did I give you your equal parts	1
Fair enough	1
So that is looking at Making an estimate okay	1
Jean take over	1
Do you know what year though	1
So Eli will you read organized information	1
The answers yes	1
Yes Maya	1
Whitney would you like me to check a problem for you	1
Yes	1
Melissa	1
He saw three times three and did you just recognize it as nine	1
All right James	1
13	1
DiscuStudents it with your group	1
Isaiah	1
And two whites can I write two  w    for two whites	1
Yes	1
One	1
Kelly do you need help	1
Okay Avery are you guys listening	1
Then have zero around here and okay	1
Do you understand the problem here	1
We figured out our largest could we figure out our smallest	1
Anybody have any questions on this one	1
So eightone so I would come over here to eight and then I would go up to one okay	1
So you think you need to explain why it okay	1
No we didnt we could get like fiftieths	1
Wheres your white sheet	1
Okay give me a thumbs up in your screen when you are ready	1
To two	1
What	1
Does anybody have any questions	1
Listen to Milin	1
What does the question say	1
What honey	1
They will kill him	1
Good	1
Okay go ahead	1
Yes	1
On this piece of paper	1
Go	1
Ariel	1
I agree that 6 divided by 13 equal whatever letter you gave it okay	1
Are there any questions on what your homework looks like For tonight	1
Um	1
Go ahead go ahead	1
Ashley did you want to share or did you have a question	1
Do you remember	1
Lets start with Kyle	1
Okay so the circumference of areas I mean the area and perimeters of rectangles and then you had circumference and you were looking at pizzas	1
Oooh you all say that there is something we can multiply by four	1
John could you turn your microphone on	1
A red one red equals one red rod up here one red equals two  of the white ones	1
Theyre equal	1
Yes	1
Challenge to change a pentagon okay	1
Onefourth of a meter is blue	1
Could I write any number sentence using these fractions	1
Do you need your Mr Parker to repeat the question	1
Does that work	1
Yes he does	1
Hey show me your whiteboards	1
Anything else	1
We talked about that we have to add six more because we already have four lines and 64 is 10 so we decided that were gonna have to have six more lines	1
Remember this one the red and  orange train	1
Wouldnt it so shouldnt it be like where one sides flat and one is to the side	1
Asher	1
Two right	1
Do you think that goes with longer and wider	1
But I  looked at the sea monster okay and I looked at the boat okay and I  was thinking about their sizes a little bit right	1
Because if you put	1
How many had the entire assignment correct	1
Should we go find Jeanie and remeasure her	1
They dont count because theyre not placeholders right	1
Andrew	1
Yeah	1
Thats what you were trying to figure out	1
You have a real hard one Erik	1
Okay and I hope that you guys every time are going back to the first column okay	1
Five	1
So 12 I did I dont know how to describe it	1
One way to do it so its 2	1
Can I go diagonal	1
And you can all  convince me	1
You need what	1
F Cameron T	1
Now youre going to turn and talk to a neighbor	1
Are you ready	1
Because is three a factor of 12	1
Dylan	1
Does that look right to you	1
So for instance if you have one half plus one third we cant add those right	1
This Is US traditional okay	1
So this is kind of tricky because usually youve got this number over here right	1
Did anyone ever pull that on you	1
What was yours	1
Understand	1
Do you have the tools now to find an answer to this	1
Oh sometimes you miss a step	1
Did I give you an area	1
Sure you don t	1
Is it going to be half	1
Brian is doing three	1
Jackie	1
Am I ready to solve it	1
Does what work	1
Are there a lot	1
Are you there	1
T and F	1
Do you understand it Juliale	1
So should I just have an answer on my board	1
Is that what I heard Nathan	1
So if we change the total number of pieces were also changing the number of pieces we care about right	1
You know what I mean	1
Mr Clyde	1
Mr Matt can you turn on your microphone	1
Pint	1
Is that true	1
So two halves make a whole	1
Thats right huh	1
Well we could count the tiny little boxes in there right	1
Um Austin	1
Well but you are doing differently now right	1
Are we ready	1
Yes	1
Audrey went good	1
075 you didnt do anything but eliminate that one	1
Reed	1
You ready	1
What	1
Fivesixths which would really be the same as this right	1
So if I made this title would that be a good title for my line plot	1
Go around three times or a binder to	1
You look at it for a minute and Ill be back to review okay	1
Is that something you guys  fractions	1
Sound good so far	1
So its not its just  approximate cause I dont think	1
Any questions so far	1
Nate came up with a really good strategy for these problems	1
Julian	1
Can we rewrite this as a  number sentence now	1
However if you buy seven of these if you buy seven you will have 210 yen left over right	1
Four twelfths	1
We have a numerator in common	1
All right who else feels like they need a lot of help	1
Questions	1
Dan	1
Larry	1
And do we have side side side	1
Are you going to check right there	1
Even on this side its good if you think about it in the same way okay	1
Were you supposed to	1
Now I said this is going to be tricky right	1
Now what do I need to look at next	1
Ready	1
Then Im going to multiply 275 times 10 squared because there are two place values right	1
The zero point	1
Maggie	1
For this it is for this	1
Questions so far on this people	1
Did you multiply here	1
200 times five times 60 times 40 times 60 times five times five times 40 times five times five	1
Im sorry what	1
What about 20	1
Now can we subtract	1
I think you can see theyre pretty right cant you	1
xaxis	1
You have another one	1
No were in math right now what should you be doing	1
That X is milliliters okay	1
Can we use four	1
Okay stand up when youre done	1
Can you get it	1
Yes	1
Would you guys like to do another one	1
Was 30 seconds enough time	1
No if I have 13 shouldnt I have colored in right here	1
So we can compare right	1
So the question Mark yesterday represented our unknown right	1
Ok  Are we ready to come back and share our ideas	1
Karin	1
Are we ready	1
Huh	1
I want you to tell me is this a function	1
Mrs Robertss class growth	1

All right theyre going to want you to use estimation today and theyre going to want to prove why your estimation works does that make sense	1
Talk	1
Thirtyfour	1

Thumbs up when you are ready	1
Gunnar	1
So this is Sofias pizza	1
Sure	1
Oh	1
Carter are you done	1
Its the same absolute value but this one would be a negative tangent right	1
50 x 6	1
We have four different  models	1
So is it okay to look at the problem and know that four times one or anything times one is that answer	1
So youd know	1
Its looking the exact same but just really big	1
How do we feel	1
Hernan	1
But isnt that a nice challenging question	1
Asher	1
Yeah they flipped right	1
Mai	1
Is that a one one under the	1
Can you do this	1

This one is	1
Do the ones that are wrong	1
Move onto the left two on the right and then draw it up	1
I dont know why but if you if you win three games for four thats the probability of winning in the fourth	1
What	1
Right so did they need all those instructions to finish your triangle	1
Yes	1
You notice how it only went up to three fourths	1
Macaroni and cheese	1
Multiplicative	1
Do you notice how we have two for all of these its a little bit easier to compare all of them	1
Alexa I pulled your name right out of the thing	1
To two decimal places 35 was it	1
Anna	1
Im I done	1
I think can you see Alan and Erik	1

No	1
Does that sounds familiar	1
Do you think youd be at the times three	1
Can I take two from three	1
Did you check yours and it was good	1
It might be easier it might be faster but either way you got the same answer right	1
I do b2a I get 2 2 because b2 negative of negative right	1
Raise your hand so I can  really be sure and you have no doubt and you feel very very strongly  about that	1

Yes it was a trapezoid right	1
Deneli	1
Okay so can you see if you can find your mistake do you think theres a mistake	1
The money right	1
So this is the triangle right	1
Is 12 times 6 nine	1
Yes	1
So you re giving a red the number name one sixth and I understand  the young ladies up at the overhead are giving red the number name  one third and can red have the number name one third and one sixth  at the same time	1
Can we do one more please	1
So why are we not using the pattern blocks to solve it	1
Two people in the room	1
Yes I do	1
The unit rate and ratio tables	1
You hear  my question	1
Thats basically what it says in my words here	1
Does anybody have any questions about that	1
Yes	1
Make sense	1
Yesterday we were making groups of oranges right	1
Would you expect one model to come up with something  different than the other	1
What	1
Im confused	1
Id be eating the same amount as that right	1
Thumbs up	1
Sarah	1
You put 28 on top of the 4	1
550000	1
Janessa are you here	1
Then on the yaxis	1
Group twos	1
Are we okay with two and five	1
Would you say if connected that this would also make a square	1
One and one third	1
Well we got six	1
How many of you would  like the explanation broken down again	1
And now does Jim have one fewer than Don if Don  has four	1
I think mines right	1
I want you to do Levi do we do that	1
We want to know how many piles of five right	1
David	1
You ended up with twentyseven of them	1
Danielle	1
If you have this guy winning and nothing else matters because this is so big compared to everything else then are you going to flatten out like that	1
One third and 30 seconds	1
Everyone seeing how she did that	1
Evie can I do that	1
So	1
Everybody agree	1
Yes Alison	1
Or two	1
Ben you with me	1
Table three nobody from your table either	1
Judith and then Julianna	1
Whats up guys	1
Tell me	1
Is that going to be less than what we started with	1
Is an estimate going to help us with that	1
A six centimeter line and then I just used compass points and joined them	1
Anybody have any questions	1
Mmm over each of  em	1
Yes Ian	1
Vertical	1
Clay	1
Yeah	1
Everything is clear for you guys	1
2000	1
So that means up here where I had my eggs I need to do 576 plus 576 right	1
What you just said	1
By the way do I really have four numbers positive	1
There on the sixth day they owe the bank We dont know anything about their spending habits if they just had one down right	1
Youll also notice the one over here huh	1
Chloe	1
Does it come together	1
Who has not had a chance to talk to the camera	1
You have to be able to say well I can tell by looking at number one that it goes with A here okay	1
Yes	1
1220 then right	1
Blake	1
So to find one fifth we divide by five right	1
Its going to be greater than right	1
Is this an isosceles	1
Does that make any sense	1
Its very similar right	1
You get one triangle right	1
We got four and a half because we drew like  we all drew a rectangle and then we split it into two and we were able to split them all so they had four	1
Rita	1
One fiftieth	1
You think you can do it	1
Uh Ho Wai Kwan	1
Theres one two right	1
What	1
Just because you give a rule of doubling or tripling or quadrupling did not give a complete response did it	1
Hum would you put up your hand if you have that one figured out	1
And that means youd have three sixths	1
I got an idea	1
What	1
Yes	1
Twentyone	1
Franc	1
I cant see	1
Divide by one	1
Did we understand a couple of number stories	1
Emmanuel youre still not seeing it	1
I want to you to talk to your shoulder partner	1
So we knew that if we take one minus a half that were going to have at least a half left okay	1
Gunner will you read that for us please	1
Maybe not huh Michael have you been thinking about that a little  bit	1
Why cant you do four and a half	1
Makes sense	1
Florist has five bunches does it matter how many flowers are in each bunch	1
Do you need	1

Understand what to do here	1
And then if I think about 141 do you remember our trick for three	1
Remember click somewhere to get rid of the other selection and then go that that that Do you remember how to measure the angles	1
My  nine meters	1
Do you know what that means	1
Im sorry what	1
If it has become this then can we do it	1
Cause if any number multiplied by zero is zero right	1
Everybody enlarge	1
But I bet we could figure it out right	1
6   1	1
Ben	1
Feels better so um that night um they gave a toast right	1
inauidble four fourths	1
Less than a half	1
It would have worked	1
No	1
or you had to go into decimals or whatever	1
I added them and I got 204	1
9	1
Let me ask you is this statement true four eighths plus five tenths equals one whole	1
Nick question	1
Meredith you were going to say  something earlier	1
Are you guys getting your work done	1
Larger	1
Yeah Brynn	1
You guys ready	1
Does that make sense	1
Okay are we ready	1
Can you solve number five mentally	1
100 right	1
So what they want is for you to box them up right	1
Jude is 38 the same thing as saying 34	1
Lets go Keilty	1
Any questions about the instructions on the second page on 139	1
So this would be one way right	1
Did you draw a picture	1
Whos feeling that they might be ready to go up and draw their tape diagram on the board	1
Can you what	1
40 slices	1
Everything you need is in Google Classroom okay	1
Do you know where you were	1
1010	1
So remember our faction circles	1
Do you still need the box	1
Milin	1
Look at the first star and read that with me	1
They re not the same units right	1
The right mark or the wrong mark okay	1
Here	1
Would that work	1
Fifteen	1
Can you give me a thumbs up if you feel good about that	1
Sarab	1
Jaxon a comment	1
But even if you didnt get the last one you got this one right	1
You have it on your paper	1
4 x 5  20 so	1
Is this ringing a bell now that you see this	1
Reduce	1
I can see my little stack here and this little stack here there is only one of them  and its all blue no red right	1
Do you see here	1
So when you draw a line segment on your paper do you put a starting point and a stopping point	1
Um are Yeah Austin	1
But is that really the right answer	1
Did you do it	1
No Im not inauidble	1
Thumbs up if you had something really similar to that	1
Of the chocolate bar	1
Can you all imagine half of it	1
Oh nevermind	1
Aiden	1
A or B	1
Okay go ahead	1
Do you want to say	1
Different towers you could make from 5 blocks up	1
Your class have no 25	1
Do we know the part do we know the whole	1
Ari	1
Avah	1
Have we established what our first number on our line plot is going to be	1
So it is legal and it s certainly true Is that alright	1
Michael which one do you want to try	1
Ill give you a choice all right	1
If it becomes like this	1
Come on Audra	1
Isn t that right	1
Can you see	1
I dont have it	1
Why dont you try	1
Fold	1
Does anybody have any questions	1
Is that is that the question	1
Did you get to the least common multiple	1
Do you want me to tell you	1
Angelique	1
Can you make a smaller one	1
Yeah Michael is right because it takes three sixths to equal one half  and if	1
Um one	1
everybody remember that	1
Anyone but Robbie	1
Two wholes right	1
Three	1
Yes	1
Im asking the question did you look at the size here	1
So have I come by to check all 10 equations yet	1
If we were reading this we would say nine times eight right	1
What	1
You guys ready	1
James dont forget your clipboard	1
Michelle	1
Terrance	1
Graham you can come and help	1
Are all of those shapes the same	1
Is that correct	1
Pretty basic addition on the first story would you agree	1
Can you work that out in your head	1
And then mark 1000 people	1
In real life if Fox was going against Avah Avah has her sheet Fox has her sheet okay	1
Its eight by eight	1
Is that what it should look like	1
Or if youre not stuck what would like me Do you want me to just check your answers then	1
Do I have a complete sentence on the board	1
Any one of you say that there is no solution	1
You know what I would like you to do	1
Sound good	1
Do you remember when your histograms were touching	1
Is that what it says	1
We write 200	1
How about you Michelle	1
Gavin do you want to share	1
1 12 and 2 and 5 15 of the chocolate bar	1
Isosceles triangle anybody see the isosceles triangle in here	1
Makes sense	1
Marcus	1
How about three three and three	1
A to the one times B to the three	1
Because youre doing a 12 and you dont have to do 14 24 34 and everything	1
Youre doing the first one right	1
Two	1
Before we move on any final questions about addition and subtraction of fractions	1
So Marcela you start	1
OK did you all hear what Mike said	1
I went over and helped these gentlemen  use our fraction circle pieces and once you really set the pieces out how much sense did it make	1
Nakila	1
So definitely a challenge problem right	1
How confident do you guys feel in this ish iffy	1
Mm hm	1
Ten ten	1
Is there a B	1
How many of you have some new thinking at the moment	1
Say it again	1
Kai	1
Maybe	1
Do we have a fraction circle with nine	1
Did you have to make sense of the table	1
Lincoln school had 10 out of out of 300 people with four siblings which is roughly one out of every 30 kids right	1
Jermaine	1
Are you guys sharing with each other once you have your lists of numbers done	1
Nice and loud	1
Go ahead	1
Is it going to be  more than nine meters	1
So Jackson go ahead and try to graph and put the table in correctly okay	1
If 204 shares is two 408 dollars one share is only two dollars isnt it	1
50000000	1
Remember that	1
Is it a straight line is it	1
Im sorry okay	1
Isnt that right	1
So if we look here  theres one two three four five six seven and eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 so one 24th will fit into  24ths itll fit in 18 times okay	1
Pam param pam pam	1
Now if I already broke apart one hole into fourths right	1
Got the point	1
Wait what was the question again	1
Its easier to do it in 12 isnt it	1
And then I color two in	1
Sky	1
Everybody at home do you have these notes down	1
The math for beyond that is can you find out where it lives	1
Do you have different ones or the same one	1
Maybe they werent thinking about it at the time	1
What questions do you have	1
Oh so Lily would you say Are you saying that thats something they have similar in both problems are already a common denominator	1
Oh then thats where you probably youve got a	1
Yeah its on dice right	1
The fives	1
Does that make sense	1
And we use things like side side side right	1
Now the fact is they continued things like this every day okay	1
Ok so Sarah and Beth you built one you dont have  enough	1
That uh that like four fourths equals  one half which equals two halves	1
Audrey went good	1
Its driving me crazy	1
1 56	1
Does that make sense	1
The one student right	1
I have problems	1
Each book costs 10 right	1
Did anybody do it that way	1
No I dont think at all	1
Last but not least Sandra	1
Danielles not sure	1
As a table group I want you to have a discussion	1
Is this thing a linear decrease	1
Now earlier today we had equivalent ratios when we were drawing our diagrams right	1
There are going to be two cuts right	1
X plus three times three equals Y	1
Are there two answers	1
Who changed this fraction	1
Did you do six times eight and then divide by two	1
Bryson	1
Miles	1
Say that again	1
Why did you did I only do six Ss	1
No	1
Here right	1
Okay so you think it is 910	1
Ah see so now youve already forgotten right	1
Paul	1
Everybody has seen an easel	1
Then now its easy right	1
Is anybody else in the line going to touch number four	1
Yes	1
To the empty set right	1
Guess what	1
Bs have you been talking yet	1
I think one half is	1
Wait just a minute tell me again	1
Do you have a question	1
Oneninth plus oneninth plus oneninth I could cut that into nine pieces and I could take four of them right	1
Mia	1
Did you show what actually could work	1
Twentyseven meter hall comes to this hall coming  down here its about from the door to um to the  middle of to when you start going down there	1
Kinsley	1
Nice and loud	1
Or you need to use it for a while	1
Can you all imagine that	1
So youd give it a number name of one	1
Well when I multiplied the fraction by a whole number at first I thought that	1
Can we tell what kind of angle this is	1
Two right	1
Now are you on your way to be able to write these stories	1
Read it	1
That that is a common mistake	1
You mean like how we got to those equivalent fractions	1
Show me a thumbs up when you are done	1
Then when he When there were leftovers for the tenths then he had to go into the next column right	1
Ari	1
Was that a slide that we did	1
Kind of like our five or more	1
Im one block away	1
Asher	1
Wyatt	1
Thumbs up	1
Sydney what is your question	1
Okay and where you have the three pizzas and how many people are sharing those three pizzas	1
Yes	1

Did you do 23	1
How many more calories I need to meet my goal right	1
You  don t know	1
Is this two Kleenexes	1
Show me some thumbs how do you feel about this equation right here	1
Can we multiply by two	1
And you can tell me if thats what you mean or not	1
Hadley	1
Paige	1
Anybody else	1
Yes	1
Someone want to give a try saying it again	1
23 of the basket are filled with apples	1
What are you doing	1
If we didnt know how to do that we could just take those 36 carrots and divide it into groups of three right	1
Are there	1
What letter will we take for the other axis	1
Asher	1
You have three different other strategies	1
Are there any questions on this homework	1
Do you understand	1
Two	1
Scarlet	1
When youve got an answer stand up	1
Sound good	1
The top of this one is this right	1
Yes	1
Jana come up here and write it up on the left side of the board	1
The three	1
Meredith	1
And y will be the ones that go up and down  basic graphing skills	1
Huh	1
Okay if were making the answer close to 400 then the decimal would have to go here right	1
See how its slanting up	1
Sam	1
Get it	1
But the answer to the problem has to be this right	1
Does one work	1
All done	1
Ok Ive heard some ideas	1
123 columns	1
And unless we are agreeing about the same thing then we are going to keep arguing past each other you know	1
Bam bara bambam	1
Ash	1
Plus	1
Do you want to do 30 minutes	1
No	1
Okay any questions so far on this one	1
Does that make sense	1
Okay so youre going to select the larger number and just ensure that youre going to end up with the three yeah	1
Skyler	1
And we you do 10 on the other one	1
Sophia	1
Where we at	1
Alreya	1
Ehm Excuse me I showed you the wrong one hm	1
Zach or not Zach Matt	1
Cecilia	1
Remember how we mark it up like what were doing between columns	1

Expanded form	1
Shall I leave it here	1
One jelly	1
Okay does that make sense	1
So this is showing two groups of Six right	1
Amy	1
Its not 14 okay	1
You dont know	1
If I put these together will they equal 34	1
Clark	1
No	1
No idea	1
You reorganized your data values	1
How are we doing	1
Haley does that make sense	1
Emma	1
Okay you guys did you triple	1
Are you able to do this	1
Here do we have any whole pieces	1
Onethird  onethird right	1
Okay go ahead Im sorry	1
Could I do 14 times 55	1
Are we clear	1
Would you know that that guy is the same as the blue triangle with	1
87 and what	1
They really seem challenging huh	1
Then would you look up again	1
Does that make sense	1
Does that make sense	1
Three and two	1
Alright whos a brave soul wholl read that number for us	1
You need some help	1
Erik	1
You have to do something to keep it there	1
for number five I got close to 3	1
Are you saying that the two the five and the 11 they only have one factor pair	1
Pete are you done	1
45 right	1
Do you see why its important that we know those basic facts	1
Everybody know what theyre doing	1
Whats the hardest thing about that three daughters sharing 12	1
Could you say that at one more time Arden	1
Are these lines perpendicular	1
Okay any questions on this one before we move on to the next one	1
This difference between a red and a  because she told me if I  put two of them here it should balance	1
28 is the same as 14 right	1
Julia	1
Do you still expect that you would get the same answer	1
How many of you took  nine meters of ribbon and measured it out	1
If I add a zero here is it still four	1
Okay	1
It s just whoever picked	1
I drew a picture	1
Oops	1
Do you have a question	1
Am I correct	1
Now Im comparing 412 to 49 if this works 49 should still be bigger right	1
Do you understand why that theirs wouldnt work	1
So if we were to count up we would get a different number right	1
Any questions	1
No	1
David you re  going to have to do it again	1
How many six can go into 47 right	1
Questions one through five	1
Yes	1
Go ahead	1
Can I show you guys a way to compare these	1

So its says Who can read number one	1
Amanda	1
Marjolein	1
Is everybody seeing that	1
So when you are drawing your picture thats what youre doing youre finding a part of a partI know you guys know how to do the algorithm and I know you are very good at it but I also want you to be able to draw a picture to go along with it too okay	1

Got it	1
Does that work	1
Piper	1
Do we know how many oranges he has	1
Who would like to read	1
You changing your mind	1
Are you just trying to be funny	1
Oh so you re saying its okay to call it one half if we call this  one	1
You have to think about the subtraction and actually the addition	1
Is this similar to what we did over here	1
Were you able to do it	1
About how many people are there who says he or she found this i were able to find it	1
You buy seven	1
Thats the same what	1
How many of you know how to multiply by 10	1
Can somebody read that	1
Can you be a little louder	1
Isnt there anyone	1
Instead of  Harriette question	1
why theyre not equal	1
If we know the area already remember how lengthwidth would be the area	1
I want someone to actually summarize what he says	1
Show me the first one	1
So am I hearing James say that one half is another name for two fourths	1
Would you please David	1
Are you following	1
Well Ive got the answers	1
Because one took it off and made a whole difference	1
All right Mr Zach you are the lucky	1
Is that going to look like a straight line	1
Do you see a connection between these numbers	1
A product right	1
Cole	1
Number one slope with twothirds starting at eight and this one is seven right	1
How much can fit into the bag	1
10	1
Fabulous can you read for us please	1
Now can I subtract	1

You wrote it down on your white paper right	1
No thats just telling me the size of the slice that I ate really not telling me how many right	1
Yes	1
Okay would you put seven in	1
A times B	1
Now just now see	1
You know what I d like you to try on the back while we re  waiting	1
Yes maam	1
One two three	1
And some other people told me a white would be one  twelfth	1
David	1
Im sorry what	1
Equal fractions	1
All right are you clearing out some of those cobwebs	1
Are you ready	1
Show your work	1
13	1
Okay any questions on what makes a function not a function	1
Zach are you redoing yours	1
Savannah	1
Think about what we need to do with this number write it on our thing and then turn and talk with your neighbors once youre written it	1
How  many of you want to make bows	1
Jessica	1
Did you guys notice how when I just showed Eve when she said she hadnt gotten to it we could walk through it together right	1
Any questions on this one	1
Emma	1
So right now we talked about thinking about our thinking right	1
Because we are looking for divisors of this right	1
Andrew	1
Can you count it like that	1
Thats something weve been practicing for a while right	1
Zuzko	1
I would have to have different in numbers wouldnt I	1
Sorry	1
Did you hear what he said	1
Are you prepared to argue that  position	1
So you guys are talking	1
So here are a couple of different diagrams that we have used before do you recognize these	1
Can we make another fraction thats equivalent to nothing	1
So area and perimeter should be a review for us	1
Can I	1
Everybody agree so far	1
32	1
Yes	1
Analies	1
It s one big secret	1
Can somebody other than Luke	1
That you thought of it like this okay	1
Drew	1
You guys can create the model super quickly okay	1
Youve got  there and then the tenth it goes up here	1
You with me	1
If you buy six six times three is 180 yen so you are still 20 yen in the red right	1
If you want elimination shouldnt we use subtraction	1
One two three four five six	1
Brandon	1
Did your rule do what you originally were supposed to do	1
Is that the biggest circle that we could draw all the way	1
Well one	1
I go to write in order but	1
Oh yes Adelle	1
Do you need some help	1
Are you seeing how it connects to what we did	1
Thumb up out of your shoulder if you got that right	1
123 Whos ready	1
Would you know that that spot right there has an X value of radical three over two and Y value of one half	1
All we know is it has two sets of equal sides right	1
Natalie	1
Thats just it	1
Will you help  remember	1
equal	1
1025	1
Laura	1
Can we do this by volunteering	1
Do I know base 1 and base 2	1
Do you have any questions	1
All right so questions comments concerns	1
What	1
Yeah Chance	1
Talk it out before you write it	1
Yes	1
Well the only thing I can do is times one correct	1
Student growth	1
Six times	1
On which one	1
Whats your question Michael	1
The small and the large right	1
Is that what you said	1
Go	1
Jitka	1
Okay did everyone have a chance to talk about it	1
You need to figure out all of the numbers between one and 100 dont you	1
Do you agree	1

Because 52 is a bit more than a half	4
90 minus beta 180 minus beta	4
Three wholes	4
We were making square numbers	4
She had  because I did 121 divided by 65	4
One one	4
Which will still be smaller than 78 good	4
Well if you split a dollar in four 75 would be the third out of the four	4

So sixteen is the whole	4
Well dark blue	4
For each of the two games you re multiplying because of that	4
How much youre making it bigger	4

The answer to that one  five twelfths	4
437 and sixtenths excellent	4
I kind of made a Because at my old school what we would do when were estimating fractions Well just bump one up so I bumped the two up to a four and then I did four plus four	4
Which I did I added my zero	4
I see River is done	4
Root three	4
inaudible 3x minus 90	4
Four minus three in parenthesis times two squared is equal to one times four is four	4
Outstanding performance in the field of trigonometry	4

Pints good	4
Were all the same length	4
Then 8  2 because theres 2 bags	4
Negative one and fivefifths or 2	4

One hundred and thirty	4
Zero nothing theyre not worth anything	4
If you do the length  the width you should get the area they gave you	4

Equal inaudible when we put them together	4
Yeah and a zero	4
Twentyseven	4
That can very possibly be right	4
The labels	4
70 is in the tenths place not the ones	4
Bigger the denominator smaller the pieces	4
Because its commutative	4
I thought that the smaller blocks were water	4
Bigger is not a description	4
yes three times five	4
So Judith is going with 610	4
I divide by 8 thats going to get the number on the top to 10	4
Where something starts or something ends	4
Ten	4
So you disagree	4
Theyre giving us a cup	4
This should have been 10	4
Two	4
To the pizzeria we have about 15 and then once we finally are at 15 and we count the rest of the squares I say you get 22	4
Yes squared	4
The denominators	4
Well so they could know where to put  the brackets	4
Or less B less than 15	4
Points that show where numbers are	4
Yes in decimals or you do it in fractions	4
Four plus three times two in parenthesis raised to the second power is equal to 100	4
Ok David thinks four twelfths	4
Lets do 18	4
Were going to divide	4
12 so we multiplied by 12	4
You want the smallest divisor	4
Yes 19 because it goes 19 17 15 13	4
Good in my big bucket	4
No its going down by different amounts and then down by 5 here	4
Dividing by two is the same as multiplying by half so the answer is yes about this much	4
You re not measuring the same	4
So you had the same thing you had a right angle and two sides	4
And you said 30	4
13 times 35 thats very beautiful Im sure  equals 3 There at least  to look good	4
Plus five times H plus five times H plus five times H plus five times H	4
Eight avocados is 4	4
You can solve multiplication by using division	4
Thirtysix	4
Thats the circumcise	4
So i am going to Subtract one Im gong to exist out one who row	4
16 and 38	4
How many pieces you need to make a whole	4
Um is it I think its 710 1000ths	4
You could start at 22 and go to 43 all Im saying is that you know	4
Squares yeah	4
I did	4
Four	4
We think maybe four	4
It wouldn t change those because it can t hit the  so it would only change this one so that would change that because it does hit zero	4
Yeah	4
Uh that two thirds is larger	4
Adding them doesnt do anything	4
One	4
But you divide by half and then you just get it exactly halfway	4
One two put your dot right there	4
Into halves	4
Okay so you followed the rule	4
Um because I think that person got it mixed up by thinking that the other times the 2 cups chocolate to the 9 the answer of the in total of 9 cups the answer of 1 cup of cream to the 9 whole to the in total of 9 cups so then he um so he made 27 cups	4
I think its bigger than	4
Two dozen equals 24	4
Where the decimal is	4
one meter we can make two	4
34	4
He said that theres going to be an open then two closed then an open and he thought that there were going to be three closed but theres actually four closed then theres an open then theres 123456 closed	4
Three	4
I was looking for that word expanded form	4
Well I used the radius	4
Brian thinks then white ones in the next train would be one  twentyfourth	4
And then for our problem we can say 16 and then your right we can divide both of these by four	4
Twentyfour right	4
Eight	4
Yes	4
Charlie look twos closed	4
Yeah we have angle angle	4
7 x 3  21	4
Mmhmm  half	4
same	4
You will say it as 14	4
Okay so one half is bigger than three eighths	4
Day 14	4
So Kaliahs telling us Duke we have to take this three Turn it into a two	4
Five	4
You think you ve got something for six	4
You can think about what you know about the problem	4
So eight twenty four	4
Romina says three	4
I think 10 is too low because 10 times 12 is 120	4
Of 54	4
Itd be in the corner	4
They are equally big as the other ones	4
So each time you have like 05 or 02 does the zero	4
Yes you can add the plus but it is not necessary	4
A red okay I didn t think I asked that clearly	4
Were buying 10 anyhow	4
I only need two get to a half	4
It would be 18 yeah	4
The picture method	4
You are going to get zero	4
I think it is 14	4
Two cups	4
So this is my hundredths place and then you said put the zero the point and the zero	4
You have to square it	4
30 squared	4
Yes its three	4
The radius is half of the diameter	4
This is our whole	4
Seventeen	4
So 13 is equivalent to 3 repeating	4
You reinvented it	4
Ninetyfive	4
And a fourth is less than a half	4
Ha yeah	4
Because six divided by three is two	4
Eleven six and zero   We talked a little bit about what does a bar graph have to have	4
To the second power	4
Three times	4
Bigger	4
Notice how X  1  30 is like one of these groups and Oliver I like how you said three times the quantity of because that shows that its in parenthesis and that would equal 30	4
12 and five tenths	4
So when you subtract the bases to get 14 and then divide by two to get seven	4
No because when we use an area model notice how we set it up we put up the 35 into 30 and 5	4
They are not	4
The top one from the bottom one language	4
Were either going to be using subtraction or division	4
Negative 20 correct	4
Youre done	4
Equally likely	4
But more of the angles	4
30 because 6  5 is 30	4
Yes he wants to buy two sets of strings for each student	4
This is partial products	4
no no because theres nothing under the zero	4
Three	4
Okay so here she goes 38	4
One times four	4
So they probably just thought it was  and they could forget about it	4
It would be 68	4
The lowest common multiple yep	4
Negative two	4
Five to two	4
Minus nine fine	4
So our shorter person is 54 inches	4
Yes you want to reduce your denominator but thats not why her methods better than mine	4
47 minus x equals 180	4
The area of the shaded rectangle all you have to do is 14 x 34	4
Seventeen so all we got to do is try one and seventeen and see what happens	4
Yes	4
Miya	4
Would it be 18	4
3x4	4
Two N	4
12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 so our total number of people would be 21	4
Because its closer to that value	4
Thats what Jeff wants to know	4
I know thats one name one twelfth	4
Unitary	4
I cant do 568 87	4
At 12 so then continue with 13	4
Hundreds grid	4
Six more	4
You go back to	4
80 and 70	4
It is the whole because that is the question that they set up here	4
Were going to say columned	4
Number sentence	4
I am confused onthis one	4
Yes its a smaller fraction than 910	4
They are all odd numbers	4
By two	4
There you go five times six	4
You just went into fourths because you knew that was a whole	4
And that is four	4
First you have to have similar denominators for those two	4
15 divided by five is three	4
2 and 6	4
Now various people are saying three	4
Five and the reason for this is after were done with five youre going to come up and teach it	4
Well it wouldnt fit	4
Yeah X equals zero	4
I counted by seven	4
so segment IG is congruent to segment AT	4
So if they only had the 2 cups of chocolate here youre saying he would have had 7 cups of cream	4
That we needed to make it smaller	4
Calories burned on the elliptical	4
Theyre gonna all be the same	4
Yeah just the opposite	4
Einstein I guess	4
The main number is the same fine	4
110 times three equals 330 which is near 308	4
SHP perfect	4
Take away one x and you get 3x  9	4
Land	4
Okay I heard the number four somewhere	4
Its okay even if its two types or even its three types	4
The numbers that you can multiply them by each other to make a product	4
What Im seeing is four wholes and one leftover which makes a half and a half	4
It had better be positive	4
A point is where something starts	4
I I is my subject	4
On the test say you  and you got that do you have to go back and check it repetitively	4
One and seventeen	4
Unless we know the miles and we actually add the actual miles we cant really add them	4
We can adapt and change in order to be able to align my words in the game of scrabble I had to find a word that had the A in the exact place that was that I could build off of it	4
Yeah	4
Eight yes	4
30 to 40	4
Ok she made a model with an orange a blue and a black	4
Three then two times three is six	4
Three	4
I mean four	4
In case its wrong you take another piece and then you use the rest of the straw	4
There would be sixteen if there were four	4
Now I have 2 and 86	4
We could divide by two absolutely	4
Youre talking about mode a little bit	4
So Frankies mom because she can go three more miles per gallon than Sammys mom	4
Yes	4
Some say expanded some say factorized	4
Twentyfour also	4
Yes a prime number	4
363 theres something that comes after this one	4
Three is subtraction	4
It WILL happen	4
I think the eight	4
This is not your homework	4
Youre probably going to have to add them up	4
Zero	4
Two times three	4
No they are on the same team	4
Thats two and notice thats why we needed that 7 to be there instead of the 6	4
You can find your common denominator	4
A whole number and a fraction	4
Even	4
So see if you can find a fraction that will fit into 12 evenly and 13 evenly	4
Yes that looks pretty good because yellow is three red is two and green is five	4
18	4
Yes	4

We know that this is 612ths	4
they are smushed together	4
They are going to equal 180	4
Yes he did	4
Three times	4
Minus o well one	4
We have the smaller blocks which are actually our koolaid	4
Yes	4
Quotient	4
Well some do but one doesnt	4
Ok so the green is one sixteenth	4
I think the very last one would be 1 first	4
Green	4
So it like two and one is three	4
All the same sides and angles	4
6 24 is 4	4
Three numbers	4
They are all like the four is divided by two	4
It s like double the shape	4
One half for example	4
I have 12 of a Kleenex	4
Equal to	4
Three cups	4
Three point five uh huh	4
Theyre equivalent	4
He needs new strings for his 19 violin students	4
And she got 110	4
That would be lower than both of them and you want to try and get it to be in the middle	4
No because six would be 126	4
If we have three pizzas there is four student sharing in Forest Preserve five students sharing four pizzas at the corn field	4
Also with area you want to know the area because if your house is too big it could hit other buildings and then it would be bad	4
Eight	4
Its surface	4
Yes but I certainly agree because its proportional and its linear	4
Three	4
This doesnt matter	4
Not positive 10	4
Something around that	4
Equals	4
Square numbers	4
Thirteen	4
Alright James says eight	4
Yes because its an even number	4
Yes all right	4
The denominator is 13	4
No so its not linear	4
Seven and four	4
We first write down 81 and then its 25	4
X cubed correct	4
So 4 and a third	4
A quarter of a pound youre exactly right	4
Okay so four avocados is 2	4
We re gonna market the game	4
Dark blue	4
How many halves go into 34	4
Its four its in between these two fours	4
Yeah you can just add	4
16 12 youve got it	4
We have 4 x 2 x 10	4
Dog	4
No	4
Subtract one	4
I didnt know eight 12	4
More than the whole group	4
We can take this denominator multiply it by two	4
1515	4
Area	4
That was already crossed out fine	4
Well you take away four X	4
If you do 12   5 you should get 110	4
You agree with them	4
90 and nine	4
Excellent eight to the tenth power	4
So Im doing four tenths times One 100ths	4
If this is my whole and I need 23 you guys already told me what shape my thirds are they are my rhombus	4
Five less	4
Three sets of four coins	4
The reason why I use this is because in the question it said use M for money and W for weeks but in my honest opinion if you use X and Y instead of the letters thats fine	4
Okay so you might go up and say uh twos 22 24 26 28 30 all the way up to 44	4
Okay so the shaded	4
On there	4
No you must do minus 17 X okay	4
50 seconds	4
How many cuts youve done	4
Yeah 25 cents goes into a dollar four times	4
We do to the top	4
Perpendicular	4
Three fourths	4
Kay good so youre talking the column for 300	4
At the very bottom	4
9 times 4 is 36	4
Why you made the boxes big this time	4
Is it 26	4
Six X Y plus four X Y and minus seven A A B plus three A B	4
Yeah that I  Okay so your ones and zeros are representing home and away	4
This is also 50	4
Decimal	4
Laura says Im going to call the red rod one	4
So we have one twelfth we have four fortyeighths	4
Two more groups of that is 24	4
No	4
We didnt say one must have X alone there	4
Its surface	4
The only common factor is one so were done and we can either multiply 3 times 12 or 9 times 4 but either way Chris you were right on	4
Counted by twos	4
Equivalent	4
Two got it	4
Eight hundred	4
Uh huh yes mark the right angle there so its clear	4
Is that partial sums or	4
I want you to have a number model or this falls into the show your work	4
They come in a set of four	4
Yes underlined twice	4
No it doeStudentt	4
lets say its five plus 10 and thats 15	4
You got two bows	4
Two	4
The numerator	4
Six	4
Two over three	4
The numerator and denominator is what I noticed	4
Yeah	4
Oh uh it is equal to uh the square root of four	4
Yes same exact thing	4
A half and a fourth	4
The only other thing I would add is that one fourth fits into two and three fourths 11 times	4
Um light green then red and white	4
In the bucket	4
Four twelfths	4
Six foot	4
Because 9  7 is 16	4
Youll find most people across the world do the unitary method but you might want to write it that way if you like	4
Now they have a common denominator	4
25 I want to have a common denominator	4
Five	4
Okay so it sounds like Chloes thinking about units and how you would share your measurements with someone	4
You just take it away	4
Yes you could write it like this Y 3  12X	4
Triangle and yes	4
So what Hunter is saying one half for the first two and the last one one fourths youre gonna divide fourths	4
and got 712	4
Taking one off changed the  answer to eight	4
Okay alright one	4
Ten	4
Yes tricks and treats	4
I cancelled the 2	4
The threes cancel out technically	4
These angles are gonna be the same	4
Six	4
Is X 11	4
I think that there s six green and four yellows	4
You counted by twos	4
Yes	4
Or 18	4
It just gives the Yintercept	4
Additions	4
The Pythagorean theorem	4
Its really close to 12	4
Is it six	4
Oh 47	4
Ninths	4
Horizontal awesome	4
36	4
10 times 10 is 100 nine times 10 is 90	4
2	4
He did the same thing as me which is use the multiplication times tables	4
So Xavier  Xavier and his table believe that this is the largest 1112 because youre eating all but one piece	4
Just positives and negatives because in general it s like quadrant one could be any of the points over here	4
To match it	4
That it is one chocolate bar	4
10 times greater or bigger	4
Six times nine	4
Nine	4
Three twelfths	4
20	4
Yeah five to six	4
Five and inauidble	4
4 times two is eight	4
yeah were gonna combine the like terms by adding them together	4
We do minus five	4
Were not doing coordinate grids	4
110 because its definitely too little	4
You subtracted it okay	4
8 times 12	4
Write two because I leave it alone	4
Im hearing he doubled the wide coordinates he maybe didnt understand it	4
Doesnt always work	4
F	4
It got easy for you great	4
Two times bigger	4
Rocks	4
One and one half one and a half and one and a half its the same	4
10 times	4
And that gave you 8	4
Because 34 on the bottom the denominator is four	4
More than 30	4
Because it helps you find the area excellent	4
So you want to do addition	4
Horizontal	4
Between the three and the zero here	4
Five	4
24 6 is 4	4
Seven okay	4
They all have a label	4
That it intercepts arc R U so it has to be half	4
So is it since its half that means its 50	4
Its somewhere where it tells you where it say  almost like a diagram  where it shows you where the nose or the  something where it is	4
If you have two even numbers you could just divide by two	4
I made the boxes big so you can have room to take your notes	4
So you can do it backwards	4
There are two	4
Minus or just two X equals plus three	4
Or from this tower Im going to put a red on the top	4
Fourteen or minus 14	4
So when you gave me that 112	4
Isosceles trapezoid thats right	4
By 2	4
So 96 divided by 3	4
Danielle thinks no	4
21 3X sure	4
Tricks and treats	4
So Michael you see that seveneighths	4
teen	4
Multiplying is commutative	4
If we doubled both of them it would be 2 and 6	4
This blue ribbon is two meters uh huh	4
No its called a diagram but thats not	4
They actually did 70 x 8	4
And X is equal to eight to minus eight	4
Very good so shes going to need a 90 in her first spot and a six in her second spot	4
I mean two	4
Four 8ths plus two 8ths so a half plus I have to think about that	4
Laura thinks it s one tenth	4
It wouldnt fit in it	4
No	4
Yes you just take it away because this is saying the opposite of X equals 25	4
The denominator	4
Not division	4
I think that it would be 363	4
And I got a whole with a remainder of one fourth so four and one fourth	4
Yeah five percent of a dollar	4
65 tenths okay	4
Zero Y	4
25 you got it	4
I will know Im successful when I can use drawings or fractions circle pieces to solve problems 25 on page 164	4
Height and length	4
You counted by four	4
7 were going to go to 7	4
It goes to negative nine so you start at negative five and you go further into the negatives so negative nine	4
Ten	4
There are 12 equal parts	4
Yes okay	4
Three sixths	4
We do minus four X	4
Two	4
Because I could get it to go into 10	4
Two	4
Jakki thinks one tenth should go in the middle	4
45	4
In the first example the  column with 300 it counts up by 300	4
Because they werent doing the work they were just doing what they know from normal subtraction which is 18  20 is 2	4
Exactly the dot was right there	4
Fourteen or X equals minus 14	4
A quarter pound	4
Oh if you want to set up an inequality equation go ahead thats fine too	4
Okay so you knew that 63 was a multiple of seven	4
So we put it inbetween equally likely and likely	4
A teaspoon	4
Three	4
They used cups as their picture good	4
30 times 60	4
set of steps	4
I get zero	4
When you write your ratio group you can write one two four	4
Youre right and thats what she said because I asked them to be smallest to largest	4
You did a very good job	4
Improper fraction	4
Correct equal to the square root of four very good	4
One	4
Michelle says no it does not work	4
My green are my fifths	4
He said that theyre all equivalent to one half	4
So our denominator on both sides is going to be equal to 96	4
Isaiah was a good coach today	4
And then since I have one half	4
Alright so what youre telling me is that in number one you have four minus one and you can just do three	4
Zero out of seven	4
Bigger okay	4
So like if we thought about you took out five	4
781	4
This one is going to be 50	4
Twentythree	4
The top	4
1000	4
The exponent right	4
Same angles and same sides so were doing 10 quick questions on this	4
No negative	4
So that would be 27	4
shp	4
Two three	4
I had 13	4
Plus one sixth thats awesome	4
Adjacent	4
So we must add minus three or do minus three	4
Theyre diagonals	4
were taking around a half close to a whole  close to half	4
Yes clearly because they give you space for four of them	4
And a whole	4
Right angle	4
So write 49 hundredths good job	4
No	4
Addition yeah	4
rhombus super close	4
And so we get this person gets one	4
No theyre all the same	4
Absolutely its correct	4
Three	4
Fraction circles are your friend	4
Three so  2x36	4
It will be less than because its	4
Cause the dog does more tricks so more treats	4
To the power of nine	4
We were looking at arrays	4
The fifth	4
You have three prepointe shoes	4
Closer to three tenths	4
I m not saying divide the line	4
Fill in that number board	4
I think what can help us is eight and 40 because you cant Well you can add something to eight to get 40 but its going to take a long time	4
It was not 12	4
Its always the same thing 949	4
Okay so we have 3 inches on the width and 3 inches on the length	4
The one with fractions they both have the same denominator for each problem	4
Right side of the 1	4
Yeah	4
Minus four	4
Yes do the exact same thing	4
Taller and wider	4
This becomes six  so its equivalent	4
9	4
Same size	4
Um the day the smaller brothers is bigger is X days later	4
Three on the top and nine on the bottom	4
Seven 14	4
Yes so 7 is in the thousands place in the seven hundred thousand in 7000	4
It is 14 okay	4
Nope not yet	4
To restart or change	4
The multiples of the numbers	4
Three out of a hundred which means I put it here	4
yeah I think thats what youre meaning	4
Yeah	4
Four	4
Half yes	4
The area of the square	4
That would be a length of eight because the length five plus the length three would add up to the length eight	4
Two pointsYou re gonna want to write that down	4
It has to be half	4
The calculation is correct but you still have to answer it	4
a sum	4
R2	4
Weve gotten the little cubes and then put them inside of the whole	4
12 3 and then times it by that	4
Yes  obvious	4
3 more for Valerie 1 for Cindy	4
30	4
No 40 is already done	4
When youre multiplying a fraction by a number higher than one its going to be greater	4
Connect them in order because if I start down here my shape is not going to work	4
Six	4
Is 100	4
Youre right I only have multiplication	4
Three	4
Nope	4
You can you can still use multiplication but you got to kind of work backwards because the numbers getting bigger from left to right so youd have to divide to go from right to left	4
Our numerator	4
Nash Im so glad you asked that question the question isnt asking what is 50 of 9 thats the question you answered	4
So wed have 12 plus one and 1740	4
Add or attach three zeros	4
When I do my homework at my house and my dad tells me its wrong but I think its right so we change it	4
So write A squared	4
Yes its like significantly higher	4
So Im just going to start by splitting it in twothirds	4
Yeah	4
I think you are doing it between zero and one	4
It s either eight or thirteen	4
18 so if you got your slope right then it should work out perfectly	4
See you did n minus 900	4
corresponding	4
Aligned	4
Multiplication	4
Three times 10	4
One so theres one half so its gonna be bigger than two	4
The gas station is 4 4	4
Two groups of three	4
I think its equivalent to one half	4
Adding more by adding zeros thats beautiful	4
Respect	4
Uh squares	4
Subtracted is past tense	4
So it does zero equals zero	4
Seven full trays so three four five six seven and then I have five carrots leftover I want to say apples so bad	4
The Pythagorean theorem	4
I can call it one fifth	4
No	4
I started with 1219 and I added 081 to make it just dollars	4
He was saying if theres nineteenfifths heres one thats five	4
Is that the ratio table	4
and the 2 here	4
We have three in this numerator	4
Because it was a good number so I counted by twos	4
Finding the common denominator	4
You should simplify	4
I have 14 and I have 12	4
Six	4
Six	4
That one D	4
Five	4
Ten and then we	4
Fivetenths is the same things as saying fiftyone hundredths	4
One	4
Like a rectangle	4
No weve already got a common denominator	4
Im actually going to write this that you saw something that was three by three	4
Because twofifths smaller pieces	4
Yeah were gonna add x add x add x you get 3x equals 90 divide by three divide by 3 x equals 30	4
An X	4
thats gonna be 82	4
I notice that they used cups as their picture	4
So what Rob just said is once you know multiplication when youre really good at multiplication it makes it easier to do fractions	4
Yeah so its 41	4
So three candies would be an odd number of candies	4
A hundred percent	4
the taco fold	4
So tax on food works differently	4
Oh they doubled it	4
If you were trying to figure out what 13 of the total area is	4
Okay so youre going to move it to the right	4
One half	4
You get 110	4
So Nathans saying theyre the same because theyre both missing one piece	4
16 dots right	4
Negative eight thats to the left eight	4
Eight	4
Well 2920	4
Ninety degrees	4
Two and to keep track of it this is often called the truth set and I am going to write it here	4
I want the smallest divisor	4
One twelfth or two  twentyfourths	4
We can divide this fraction by three	4
A half meter	4
One thats shorter	4
You are correct at 16	4
Just three	4
Yes its going to be this flat line right here	4
Michelle thinks 16	4
Yes three is the denominator	4
The ones of A B and C	4
Less	4
Equlity	4
I think eleven	4
This tells me how many pieces are in the whole thing this tells me how many I ate we dont need to mess with the denominator we only need to add the numerator as long as our denominators are the same	4
Um twentyfour whites	4
Denominator	4
Its going to be less orangey	4
Two groups of four	4
A wall diagonal	4
I ll write minus twelve	4
we did very good	4
This is a three by three	4
Equals 27	4
Okay from seven to nine	4
Then theyll be the same as three	4
Maybe he could explain how he got their money and how they got that number	4
Four plus 12 correct	4
Five total zeros	4
Well I used just the remainder	4
The strings are two each	4
Yeah three and a fourth	4
Two zeros	4
Yes so draw the triangle again	4
No	4
Theres just half of one theres just half of one	4
One sixth	4
Multiply the numerator and the denominator with the same number	4
Because it looked easier	4
Ha yeah nine is wrong	4
The equal too	4
24	4
Theres eight leftover	4
Theyre verticle	4
Anyways I put negative three so I put twothirds and then	4
You need to subract four	4
Fourths	4
It is not measured in kilometers	4
No	4
Its 20 million	4
So if I multiply 25 by 33 Im multiplying by one	4
What youre saying is you did basically eight times three is 24 and you multiplied by 22	4
You needed to make it smaller	4
Yeah four twentieths	4
210 of 8	4
Yes	4
Its five percent of a dollar	4
Oh it is 12	4
Well just go ahead and calculate instead of  do the intermediate step	4
So nine	4
They did Its going to yes 10 is 0	4
You can estimate	4
C	4
Two cups split in half then they also did it in a numbered sentence and they said that two halves divided by one unit times two units equals four halves	4
Minus four its all youve gained Miss	4
Ill make three bows	4
6   12 I will get 2	4
So that would leave that that would be 6	4
So Id have one and 918 so that would be 10 Oh sorry let me go back Im adding wrong	4
There isnt one it would be 25	4
It became zero	4
You will find that it is 10	4
Is it that 2 is supposed to be 2000 instead of 200	4
3	4
I am a dog	4
Three plus three	4
You subtract whatever is in that column	4
Ok so you said there was a rule like this you  found the secret twelve divided by one third you  found that by multiplying twelve times three and  getting thirtysix	4
There shouldnt be a gap	4
She  two wholes	4
Its going to be five right	4
Two	4
The root of the number yes	4
Oh you two and one is three	4
Yes so anything you do to the bottom youre going to do to the top	4
Because 17 the pieces are smaller and on 13 one piece is bigger than the one piece of 17	4
Five	4
Five good	4
Yeah were gonna plug in eight for x	4
I see youve substituted X with one for example and one cubed minus one cubed equals zero	4
They say they only use a unit fraction one time	4
Seventeen and then directly one can have our solution which is well 17	4
You could have the hour hand on the 6 or the 12 and the minute hand on the three	4
Six	4
And then I went up to five	4
I counted by four	4
So you did 50 times 8	4
Yeah that its equal	4
34 hmm Kay	4
Divisible	4
One	4
Two times two you remember	4
I could like it could be a	4
And two browns	4
minus er minus the X either negative or positive	4
Because its funraising	4
You dont even have that one	4
20 ounces you got it	4
This lets us know that 58 would fit into three and 48 five and 35 times	4
well composite has more than two factors	4
Can you go up by either 10 or 12	4
I think justified means make it right because a judge  justified	4
Three is not going to work	4
Minus eight	4
By two	4
Okay compared to earlier in the year you think absent   kids being out sick could maybe on the increase right now cause of allergies	4
four cups which means they have enough water	4
The second number stays the same as the first one	4
A field trip if Im doing it on that when Im thinking about table groups I have to think about how many people I want into groups	4
The squared numbers separate	4
Five so its not consistent	4
Your next step for should be multiplication to division Youre going to have multiplication	4
Three	4
You go to 15 or 18	4
The origin	4
Enlarge	4
Two	4
Good except say it in the right order three times six	4
Then after I got all those I started adding them up so that I could get my answer which is 528	4
Hundreds	4
12 okay	4
You think 12	4
I saw it differently	4
How much they cost	4
Yeah they all have a three four	4
225 meters per second	4
The 90s right	4
Like threes	4
So KHCE you want three points in a straight line and then one other point	4
200	4
Ten eleven and thirteen might be   let me see	4
Those arent the same	4
It is solvable	4
One okay	4
90 99 108	4
Theyve been even numbers	4
Yeah youre going to get your whiteboards out and your dry erase markers	4
I got three bows	4
The oldest daughter gets more than the two sisters	4
A A S or S A A yep	4
The opposite sides are parallel	4
6 times two is 12	4
Thirteen yes	4
You do minus five	4
I like that you also added a decimal when you said 25 that you also added that fraction and the percent and the decimal into the mix	4
Six 24ths	4
Heres this three   3 x 5 because were trying to get the Mrs Reevess to 15 cans	4
It doesnt matter	4
Well she keeps saying that the length of this is thirteen	4
Or is does it have to be exact	4
20 times 90	4
Its appro approximate	4
Perfect its closer to a hundred percent than 50 percent Paulina said	4
5 and 23 yards	4
One green	4
One and 165ths plus 165ths Leftover	4
I shouldnt see 4 10 I should see inches	4
Three and 11 hundredths is correct	4
Its fine if you just wrote 5 for that one	4
Fourtenths	4
I think  multiples of the numbers	4
I think its about this big	4
Four steps	4
18	4
We ll find the answer	4
if my estimate is correct my answer will be close to zero	4
Were right	4
You would have to square	4
Five minutes	4
She can	4
Four	4
The hundredths place	4
Yes	4
Its more than half	4
Two	4
48	4
4 x squared root of 3	4
Then Ill plug it to	4
They are the same	4
One	4
I did times 10	4
A rectangle	4
It represents how many cars there are	4
It is positive because it lays above the axis	4
So color one of those ends really dark	4
In the same trajectory	4
Factors	4
So to X is one belongs Y is 15	4
Zoe says I know that five times six equals 30	4
You should have an identity on your sheet that says cos2    1   sin2	4
Inches	4
Also C	4
The numerator	4
I think that the architect would need to consider the area because if you dont consider the area you might have a nonequal house or it might be lopsided or something	4
First were going to calculate the fourth powers and later the answers well subtract	4
Zero so on your number line I want everyone to write a zero	4
365 days in a year	4
Yes it means parts	4
25 equals 100	4
Yes	4
So she put that in order	4
Not the same	4
Just one triangle	4
You re not sure what the questions is	4
No	4
See if one of your diagrams represents 3 cups of tomato sauce and 9 tablespoons of oil	4
Just put put the number	4
Orange yes lets look at the orange	4
Yes negative X because its on the other side	4
Three	4
I believe I have to know the diameter	4
So we do minus four X	4
Things I want come last	4
It is their pace	4
Okay so then it would be no because I thought it would be bigger	4
Okay so you split 156 into 150 and six	4
240	4
All sides	4
Three is not going to work	4
Oh three cans	4
8 x 6	4
Mmhmm	4
The ice cream shop	4
Multiplicative identity property yes	4
Yes thats the cosine	4
Six	4
Thats a lot	4
So now youll agreeokay	4
I love that you used the word grid	4
Not 10s tenths that TH on the end good	4
One and three	4
14 months	4
And as both are the same X is plus five equals zero	4
The light green ok	4
So Ember has chosen to use the bottom clue at the very bottom three and 15	4
Its one in eightyeights and one	4
We do	4
Six X	4
55 and its square units we dont know	4
I revisited another lesson on multiplication	4
Adding	4
So there are different ways of seeing	4
You know the equation A squared plus B squared equals C squared	4
Um inaudible so that answers might have to be like smushed together	4
The length of the sides	4
Yes the lines in there	4
Four so lets give this a denominator of four	4
When I figured out the formula it got easy after that	4
Yeah	4
I did five  times ten equals fifty	4
Once twice	4
Youre on the right track but were not worried about how long its going to take us	4
It is a good way	4
There are two different exponents	4
One	4
Denominator	4
It has to be half of that intercepted arc	4
Dont tell me scoot it	4
I did it the same way too	4
The numbers that you multiply by each other to get a product	4
Zero	4
210	4
Theyre animals	4
I think I would multiply the denominators together to see what the common denominator is	4
Yep lets divide the first column by five	4
30	4
90 degree angle	4
Inches	4
Now repeat is just kind of something that we like remember	4
So in our very first column we want to get the orange juice to one so lets divide by three	4

What are we trying to figure out	5
Well I made a model  that had the white was one fortyeighth and the purples were  twelfths and the white was I mean the red was twentyfourths and I  took two browns as the thirds and two dark greens as the fourths  and they I called them the fourths and then the whole was four  oranges and two purples	5
Is it gonna take three or is it gonna take four	5
Mason what do we do with the two twodigit numbers	5

Who havent I heard from Emiliano what do you think	6
Yeah um and two fourths is equal to one half	6
Thats true	6
You need a little bit more than 10 to buy them	6
Why halves darling	6
Why did you do four plus two and divided it by two	6
Why do you think that is a complete sentence	6
One half plus one half is two twos because you dont add the denominator	6
Who could  explain why	6
What I think is I think that were going to do five times six or 10 times six	6
Why	6
Why is it different	6
How do you know	6
Its hard	6
And how do you know	6
Why did we even do this	6
Why do you think its important	6

Suppose you have a choice to be player A or player B which would you choose and why	6
I think we should divide	6
And how did you know	6
Did you think more about why multiplying and then dividing would work	6
Why would that ended up being 11 no matter what	6
But you have to tell me why	6
We think its the same	6
Why did we choose the five	6
Can you suppose someone cause I dont understand why  this procedure works I understand what you explained to  me but I want to know why this works cuz this seems to  work too	6
Whats your reasoning	6
Wait why did you change this to a three	6
Why 44	6
Can you figure out reasoning behind all of this	6
Why 3000 versus 1000	6
Or by 6 so why fourths in this particular problem	6
You  Why	6
I want you to think about before we move on and go through A B C and D which one of these was the hardest to answer and why	6
Do you know why	6
Why are there three with two ones	6
Explain why	6
Why didnt you carry your one on that side	6
Why is it not my best choice	6
The I did 3  8 which is eleven and then 5  1 which is 9 and then  right here	6
Becuase you want to know what the warm up was about	6
So why did you pick four fourths to start	6
Okay explain to me why	6
Why	6
Ok now youre saying something different here ok why	6
They paid the same rate because	6
Ok tell me what youre showing up here uh Sarah and  Beth	6
First I subtracted the thing but then I divided the number I got so its 13	6
Why do you think they take videos of you	6
Tell me why or why not	6
Because we dont need the small problems	6
Why not	6
Why wouldnt I just be able to go 34	6
Why	6
If you have  if youre doing one half youre still multiplying both probabilities	6
With a raised hand can you guys tell me why I want to add that information in the first column Bailey	6
No because why couldnt I say 110 210 310 410 1010	6
Halfs	6
Jessie How do you know that	6
Why did you use 15 Remy	6
You round up	6
Why	6
Why is that true	6
Okay and why Michael one more time	6
Me	6
Chase do you feel like telling us why	6
Why plus 6	6
Explain to me why this is false	6
Why is it two and one half	6
You may but why would you do that since you have the formula	6
Why wont this work	6
How do you know	6
Maybe you multiply by 3	6
Okay so were going to restate and say I know my answer is reasonable because	6
Why is it not my best choice	6
Who  could explain why	6
80 times five	6
Why	6
Tell us why	6
Ah the numerator is two why is the numerator two	6
What do you think I have not written a number sentence on the board	6
Why are you not using 10s to estimate	6
Why is it two	6
Its not the way to put  A ruler has the different numbers  that you count by so if you have all these 1s and you dont  have the numbers that they belong to then	6
So why do we need at least two clues	6
When you	6
Five  times	6
And why	6
I understand that but I want to know why it works	6
Why did you pick four and eight	6
Okay why	6
3x39	6
How did you justify	6
Why or Why not	6
Then three plus one to make that four	6
Why	6
Why  wouldn t why wouldn t I call this if I called this one I  wouldn t call green a half and I wouldn t call yellow a half	6
Michael why do you disagree with that	6
Why is it not a bad thing	6
Anybody want to explain why	6
Yes	6
Why six times three	6
Why	6
That would be times four	6
Why  does that work	6
Why are we multiplying them both by eight	6
So we must have made an error	6
30 times 20 and 30 times five	6
You can get 25 you can get hundred divided by four	6
And how do you know	6
So why isnt it twofourths	6
How did you know that it was 50	6
X	6
Okay how  why do you have to add the square inches	6
But why does that work	6
So why is that bigger	6
I would like for somebody to expand a little bit on how we know that a quarter is 14 of a dollar	6
Because if you have	6
Why did you choose the two  oranges to be one	6
Why are they different	6
I have one pizza that Im going to share with three people Im going to cut that pizza into three slices and everybody gets one bite what if they chopped up that pizza for me already and they gave us six slices still three people but now Im going to share six slices how do I know how many slices each persons gonna get	6
And why would we have missed the problem	6
Seven	6
And how do you know	6
Tera why do I have people share their strategies	6
First you have do 1 x 2	6
Okay why	6
Why do you say that	6
Why wouldnt you have just done 41	6
So for these four examples were going to talk about how do we know that theyre the same	6
When we multiply a whole number by a fraction less than one such as 6  23 was the product greater than or less than the whole number and why	6
How do we know	6
Why does it not work	6
Youre right guys this is this is the most important part of the math learning today is why	6
Why am I changing that Gerald	6
Why is it that for number one you can find the answer even without finding a common denominator Marie	6
Why am I the vertex of this angle	6
How do you know that its between one and two and then its not smaller than one	6
Yeah	6
Seven greens and three yellows	6
Who wants to come up and say why this one has to be true	6
Why	6
I really want to know because theyre numbers up there and I added my numerators why dont I add my denominators	6
And why did you to two times two	6
Now why are we going to use a ratio table this time around instead of long division	6
Why fifths	6
Becca show me what you thought was the easiest and why	6
Why not	6
If they are we need to explain why	6
Finely what do you what do you think	6
And why are you changing	6
Why	6
OK	6
Why would I choose minus six and eight	6
So can we talk about why we would put it there	6
44 why	6
Why	6
So what happened when you did you ever double the second one	6
Because	6
I knew it couldnt be A and it couldn t be B so I said it was D	6
Can t why	6
Does anybody have when they were talking to their tablemates what they think is a good reason why it is since you all thought it was	6
One	6
No	6
In this case for example I would ask Missy why do you think your answer is correct	6
Negative	6
Three tenths	6
Its not included	6
1920	6
No because why Anna	6
Why third	6
Nope why did you put that	6
How did you know it was three and fourfifths	6
How do you know	6
Why	6
And I would like to hear again  why that would work could you tell me Erin	6
But the funny part about this is I never knew until I started teaching math why put the zero there	6
Why is this not going to work for fourths	6
Yes but why is this not the right answer	6
Who do you think is correct and why	6
Then we take 300 and put it on the side of	6
Yes	6
The year were in right now	6
And Ill let people take a look at that and see if they understand why are we replacing s instead of n in this problem	6
Why doesnt it work	6
Why Julia	6
So Mr Max why do we find a common denominator	6
Okay so explain why you carried that one Austin	6
But why does it work is my question to you	6
Why do you suppose	6
Naomi why	6
Why	6
Why or why not	6
Why did you do that	6
Who can explain why using that wedge	6
And how does that connect to the Pascal triangle that you drew	6
Whos the better surfer and why	6
Why dont I add 4  4	6
Why is five greater	6
How come you wrote yours three fourths and two thirds and she wrote hers one third and three fourths	6
But why	6
Why did you choose the two  oranges to be one	6
Why did you add nine plus eight	6
Im real confused though about why the three why why  multiply by three why not multiply by two	6
So you move six to here and why cant you subtract them	6
Um I did the first way umm three times three	6
Why do  you think I had my arrow going the other way	6
How do you know that Sylas	6
How did that change it	6
No wrong	6
What do you guys think and why	6
What I did was 5 sixths plus 2 sixths equals 7 sixths	6
How come	6
This acts as four	6
They use two grids because why	6
Okay now why cant you figure out what fraction this represents by just counting the pieces	6
Are you aware of why youre making arrowheads	6
I figures out to  down because I was doing this	6
