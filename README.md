# Text-GCD
GCD was initially proposed by Sagar Vaze et al(S. Vaze, K. Hant, A. Vedaldi and A. Zisserman, "Generalized Category Discovery," 2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), New Orleans, LA, USA, 2022, pp. 7482-7491, doi: 10.1109/CVPR52688.2022.00734.). for use in the field of image processing. Since reproducing this model was necessary for experiments in generalized category discovery in the text domain, we are open-sourcing the modified code for reference by those in the NLP field.


The results of the talkmoves dataset were reproduced.(Abhijit Suresh, Jennifer Jacobs, Charis Harty, Margaret Perkoff, James H. Martin, and Tamara Sumner. 2022.
